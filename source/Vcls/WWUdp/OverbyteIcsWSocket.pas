History:
If not otherwise noted, changes are by Francois Piette
Jul 18, 1996  Move all low level socket to winsock to be Delphi 2.x compatible
Sep 18, 1996  Use structured exception for handling errors
Sep 19, 1996  Check csDestroying before invoking event handler
Nov 04, 1996  Better error handling
Jan 31, 1997  Changed property assignation for Addr, Port and Proto
              Added notification handler
Feb 14, 1997  Corrected bug in property assignation for Addr, Port and Proto
Mar 26, 1997  Make UDP protocol work correctly
              Enable UDP broadcasting by using addr 255.255.255.255
Apr 1, 1997   Added class function when independent of any open socket
              Moved InitData as global
              Added ReceivedFrom function
              Added ResolveHost function
Jul 22, 1997  Adapted to Delphi 3 which has a modified winsock.accept
Aug 13, 1997  'sin' member made public
Aug 24, 1997  Create the only help
              Makes writing HSocket the same as calling Dup.
Sep 5, 1997   Version 2.01, added WinsockInfo function
Sep 21, 1997  Version 2.02, make it really thread safe
                            created global WSocketVersion
Sep 25, 1997  Version 2.04, port to C++Builder
Sep 27, 1997  Version 2.05. All class methods converted to global
              procedure or function because C++Builder do not like
              class method very much.
              Old class method              New global function
              ----------------              -------------------
              WinsockInfo                   WinsockInfo
              SocketErrorDesc               WSocketErrorDesc
              GetHostByAddr                 WSocketGetHostByAddr
              GetHostByName                 WSocketGetHostByName
              ResolveHost                   WSocketResolveHost
              HostName                      LocalHostName
Oct 02, 1997  V2.06 Added a check in destructor to avoid calling WSACleanup at
              design time which crashes the excellent Eagle Software CDK.
Oct 16, 1997  V2.07 Added PortNum property with numeric value for Port.
              Added RcvdCount property to return the number of
              characters received in the buffer but not read yet. Do not
              confuse with ReadCount which returns the number of chars
              already received.
              Added a check for FWait assignation in front of ReadLine
              Prefixed each TSocketState value by 'ws' to avoid name conflict.
              Moved FHSocket member to private section because the property
              HSocket does the right job.
              Added a check for state closed when changing Port, Proto and Addr.
Oct 22, 1997  V2.08 Added Flush method (asked by john@nexnix.co.uk) and
              FlushTimeout property (default to 60 seconds).
Oct 22, 1997  V2.09 Added SendFlags property to enable sending in or out of
              band data (normal or urgent, see RFC-1122)
Oct 28, 1997  V2.10 Added an OnLineTooLong event and code to handle the case
              where ReadLine has been called and the buffer overflowed (line
              long)
Oct 29, 1997  V2.11 Added DnsLookup functionnality (DnsLookup method, DnsResult
              property and DnsLookupDone event).
              Calling the connect method with a hostname work well except that
              it could block for a long period (ie: 2 minutes) if DNS do not
              respond. Calling the connect method with a numeric IP address will
              never block. So you can call DnsLookup to start hostname
              resolution in the background, after some time you evenutually
              receive the OnDnsLookupDone event. The copy the DnsResult property
              to the Addr property and call connect.
Oct 30, 1997  V2.12 added a check in DnsLookup to handel numeric IP which do
              not require any lookup. The numeric IP is treated immediately
              and immediately trigger the DnsLookupDone event.
              I modified the code to be compatible with Delphi 1.
Oct 31, 1997  V2.13 added CancelDnsLookup procedure.
Nov 09, 1997  V2.14 add LocalIPList function to get the list of local IP
              addresses (you have two IP addresses when connected to a LAN
              and an ISP).
Nov 11, 1997  V2.15 Made TCustomWSocket with virtual functions. This will
              allow to easily descend a new component from TCustomWSocket.
              Make ReadLine stop when the connection is broken.
Nov 12, 1997  V2.16 Corrected bug (Justin Yunke <yunke@productivity.org>)
              in LocalIPList: phe should be checked for nil.
Nov 18, 1997  Added ReceiveStr function (Suggested by FLDKNHA@danisco.com)
Nov 30, 1997  V2.18 Added a call to OnDnsLookupDone when canceling.
Dec 04, 1997  V2.19 Added LocalPort property and SessionConnected event
              for UDP socket.
              V2.20 Modified MessageLoop and ProcessMessages to process not
              only the socket messages, but all messages (necessary if the
              thread has several TWSocket for example).
Dec 09, 1997  V2.21 Corrected a minor bug in ReceiveStr. Detected by
              david@e.co.za (David Butler).
Dec 10, 1997  V2.22 Corrected a minor bug in Send which now correctly
              returns the number of bytes sent. Detected by
              james.huggins@blockbuster.com
Dec 16, 1997  V2.23 Corrected a bug which prevented the receiving of datagram
              from a UDP socket.
              Thank to Mark Melvin (melvin@misrg.ml.org) for pointing it.
Dec 20, 1997  V2.24 Added the PeekData function as suggested by Matt Rose
              mcrose@avproinc.com
Dec 26, 1997  V2.25 Added the Text property as suggested by Daniel P. Stasinski
              <dse@pacific.net>. Made GetXPort work even when listening as
              suggested by is81024@cis.nctu.edu.tw.
Jan 10, 1998  V2.26 Check for null hostname in DNSLookup
              Added DnsResultList with all IP addresses returned form DNS
Jan 13, 1998  V2.27 a Added MultiThreaaded property to tell the component that
              it is working in a thread and should take care of it (call
              internal ProcessMessages in place of Application.ProcessMessages,
              and do not use the WaitCtrl object).
Jan 15, 1998  V2.28 WMAsyncSelect revisited to work properly with NT winsock 2.
Feb 10, 1998  V2.29 Added an OnError event. If not assigned, then the component
              raise an exception when the error occurs.
Feb 14, 1998  V2.30 Published Text property
Feb 16, 1998  V2.31 Added virtual methods to trigger events
              Renamed all event handler variable to begin with FOn
Feb 26, 1998  V2.32 Added procedure PutDataInSendBuffer and PutStringInSendBuffer
              Using PutDataInSendBuffer you can place data in the send buffer
              without actualy trying to send it. This allows to place several
              (probably small) data chunk before the component attempt to send
              it. This prevent small packet to be sent. You can call
              Send(nil, 0) to force the component to begin to send data.
              If the buffer was not empty, PutDataInSendBuffer will just queue
              data to the buffer. This data will be sent in sequence.
Mar 02, 1998  V2.33 Changed the error check with WSAstartup as pointed out by
              Donald Strenczewilk (dstrenz@servtech.com)
Mar 06, 1998  V2.34 Added a runtime property to change the buffer size.
Mar 27, 1998  V2.35 Adapted for C++Builder 3
Apr 08, 1998  V2.36 Made SetDefaultValue virtual
Apr 13, 1998  V2.37 Reset FDnsLookupHandle to 0 after a failed call to
              WSACancelAsyncRequest
Apr 22, 1998  V2.38 Published AllSent property to let outside know if our
              buffer has some data unsent.
Apr 28, 1998  V2.39 Added LingerOnOff and LingerTimeout. Default values are
              wsLingerOn and timeout = 0 to behave by default as before.
              This value is setup just before Connect. Call SetLingerOption to
              set the linger option on the fly (the connection must be
              established to set the option). See winsock.closesocket on line
              help (winsock.hlp or win32.hlp) for a dsicussion of this option
              usage.
May 06, 1998  V2.40 Added a workaround for Trumpet winsock inet_addr bug.
              Thanks to Andrej Cuckov <andrej@cuckov.com> for his code.
May 18, 1998  V2.41 Jan Tomasek <xtomasej@feld.cvut.cz> found that Trumpet
              Winsock (Win 3.11) has some bugs and suggested a workaround in
              TryToSend procedure. This workaround makes TWSocket blocking in
              some cases. A new property enables the workaround. See code.
Jun 01, 1998  V2.42 In finalization section, check for not assigned IPList.
Jun 15, 1998  V2.43 Added code to finalization section to unload winsock if
              still loaded at that point (this happend if no socket where
              created but WinsockInfo called). Suggested by Daniel Fazekas
              <fdsoft@dns.gyor-ph.hu>
Jun 27, 1998  V2.44 Added checks for valid arguments in SetPort, SetProto
              and SetAddr. Deferred address resolution until Connect or Listen.
Jul 08, 1998  V2.45 Adadpted for Delphi 4
Jul 20, 1998  V2.46 Added SetWindowLong(FWindowHandle, 0, 0) in the destructor
              and a check for TWSocket class in XSocketWindowProc.
              Added virtual method RealSend.
Jul 23, 1998  V2.47 Added a TriggerSessionClosed from TryToSend in case of
              send error. This was called before, but with a nul error argument.
              Now it correctly gives the error number.
              Added a trashcan to receive data if no OnDataAvailable event
              handler is installed. Just receive the data and throw it away.
              Added reverse dns lookup asynchronous code (IP -> HostName).
              Thanks to Daniel Fazekas <fdsoft@dns.gyor-ph.hu> for his code.
Jul 30, 1998  V2.48 Changed local variable "error" by FLastError in SocketError
              to make it available from the OnError handler. Thanks to
              dana@medical-info.com for finding this bug.
              In Abort procedure, deleted all buffered data because it was send
              the next time the socket is opened !
              Added CancelDnsLookup in Abort procedure.
Aug 28, 1998  V2.49 Made InternalClose and ReceiveStr virtual
Sep 01, 1998  V2.50 Ignore CancelDnsLookup exception during destroy
Sep 29, 1998  V2.51 In InternalClose, protect AssignDefaultValue with
              try/except because SessionClosed event handler may have destroyed
              the component.
Oct 11, 1998  V2.52 Changed Shutdown(2) to Shutdown(1) in Internal Close to
              prevent data lost on send. You may have to call Shutdown(2) in
              your own code before calling Close to have the same behaviour as
              before.
              Changed argument type for ASyncReceive and passed 0 from FD_CLOSE
              message handler.
Oct 28, 1998  V2.53 Made WSocketLoadWinsock and WSocketUnloadWinsock public.
Nov 11, 1998  V2.54 Added OnDisplay event for debugging purpose
Nov 16, 1998  V2.55 Ignore WSANOTINITIALIZED error calling CloseSocket. This
              occurs when using TWSocket from a DLL and the finalization
              section is called before destroying TWSocket components (this is
              a program logic error).
              Made some properties and methods protected instead of private.
              Made some methods virtual.
              Added an Error argument to InternalClose.
              Added DoRecv virtual function.
              Added WSocketResolvePort
              Added WSocketResolveProto
              Deferred port and protocol resolution until really needed
              Transformed Listen to procedure (in case of failure Listen
              always calls SocketError which triggers an exception or the
              OnError event).
Nov 22, 1998  V3.00 Skipped from V2.55 to V3.00. Socks support is major update!
              Added SOCKS5 (RFC-1928) support for TCP connection and
              simple usercode passwword authentication.
              Consider the socks code as beta !
              New properties: SocksServer, SocksPort, SocksUsercode,
              SocksPassword, FSocksAuthentication. New events: OnSocksError,
              OnSocksConnected, OnSocksAuthState.
              I used WinGate 2.1d to test my code. Unfortunately WinGate do
              not correctly handle user authentication, so the code here is
              just untested...
Dec 05, 1998  V3.10 Removed ReadLine feature using TWait component.
              Added new TCustomLineWSocket and TCustomSyncWSocket.
              Those modifications implies that the ReadLine functionnality is
              slightly changed. Notably, the end of line marker is now
              configurable and remains in the received line unless a timeout
              occurs or the buffer is too small.
Dec 10, 1998  V3.11 Added missing code to resolve port in the Listen method.
Dec 12, 1998  V3.12 Added write method for LocalPort property. Thanks to
              Jan Tomasek <xtomasej@feld.cvut.cz> for his code.
              Added background exception handling.
              Fixed a bug in TCustomLineWSocket.TriggerDataAvailable which was
              not calling the inherited function when it actually should.
              Added a check on multithreaded in WaitForClose to call the
              correct ProcessMessages procedure.
              Added SOCKS4 support (only tcp connect is supported).
Dec 28, 1998  V3.13 Changed WSocketResolveHost to check for invalid numeric
              IP addresses whitout trying to use them as hostnames.
Dec 30, 1998  V3.14 Changed SetPort to SetRemotePort to solve the SetPort
              syndrome with BCB. Also chnaged GetPort to be consistant.
Jan 12, 1999  V3.15 Introduced DoRecvFrom virtual function. This correct a bug
              introduced in V3.14 related to UDP and RecvFrom.
Jan 23, 1999  V3.16 Changed FRcvdFlag computation in DoRecv and DoRecvFrom
              because it caused problems with HTTP component and large blocks.
              Removed modification by Jan Tomasek in TriggerDataAvailable
Jan 30, 1999  V3.17 Added WSocketResolveIp function.
              Checked for tcp protocol before setting linger off in abort.
              Moved a lot of variables from private to protected sections.
              Removed check for Assigned(FOnDataSent) in WMASyncSelect.
Feb 03, 1999  V3.18 Removed useless units in the uses clause.
Feb 14, 1999  V4.00 Jump to next major version number because lots of
              fundamental changes have been done. See below.

              Use runtime dynamic link with winsock. All winsock functions
              used by TWSocket are linked at runtime instead of loadtime. This
              allows programs to run without winsock installed, provided program
              doesn't try to use TWSocket or winsock function without first
              checking for winsock installation.
              Removed WSocketLoadWinsock and all use to DllStarted because it
              is no longer necessary because winsock is automatically loaded
              and initialized with the first call to a winsock function.

              Added MessagePump to centralize call to the message pump.
              It is a virtual procedure so that you can override it to
              cutomize your message pump. Also changed slightly ProcessMessages
              to closely match what is done in the forms unit.

              Removed old stuff related to WaitCtrl (was already excluded from
              compilation using a conditional directive).

              Added NOFORMS conditional compilation to exclude the Forms unit
              from wsocket. This will reduce exe or dll size by 100 to 150KB.
              To use this feature, you have to add NOFORMS in your project
              options in the "defines" edit box in the "directory/conditional"
              tab. Then you must add a message pump to your application and
              call it from TWSocket.OnMessagePump event handler. TWSocket really
              need a message pump in order to receive messages from winsock.
              Depending on how your application is built, you can use either
              TWSocket.MessageLoop or TWSocket.ProcessMessages to quickly build
              a working message pump. Or you may build your own custom message
              pump taylored to your needs. Your message pump must set
              TWSocket.Terminated property to TRUE when your application
              terminates or you may experience long delays when closing your
              application.
              You may use NOFORMS setting even if you use the forms unit (GUI
              application). Simply call Application.ProcessMessages in the
              OnMessagePump event handler.
              OnMessagePump event is not visible in the object inspector. You
              must assign it at run-time before using the component and after
              having created it (in a GUI application you can do that in the
              FormCreate event, in a console application, you can do it right
              after TWSocket.Create call).
Feb 17, 1999  V4.01 Added LineEcho and LineEdit features.
Feb 27, 1999  V4.02 Added TCustomLineWSocket.GetRcvdCount to make RcvdCount
              property and ReceiveStr work in line mode.
Mar 01, 1999  V4.03 Added conditional compile for BCB4. Thanks to James
              Legg <jlegg@iname.com>.
Mar 14, 1999  V4.04 Corrected a bug: wsocket hangup when there was no
              OnDataAvailable handler and line mode was on.
Apr 21, 1999  V4.05 Added H+ (long strings) and X+ (extended syntax)
              compilation options
May 07, 1999  V4.06 Added WSAECONNABORTED to valid error codes in TryToSend.
Jul 21, 1999  V4.07 Added GetPeerPort method, PeerPort and PeerAddr propertied
              as suggested by J. Punter <JPunter@login-bv.com>.
Aug 20, 1999  V4.05 Changed conditional compilation so that default is same
              as latest compiler (currently Delphi 4, Bcb 4). Should be ok for
              Delphi 5.
              Added LocalAddr property as suggested by Rod Pickering
              <fuzzylogic123@yahoo.com>. LocalAddr default to '0.0.0.0' and is
              intended to be used by a client when connecting to a server, to
              select a local interface for multihomed computer. Note that to
              select an interface for a server, use Addr property before
              listening.
              LocalAddr has to be an IP address in dotted form. Valid values are
              '0.0.0.0' for any interface, '127.0.0.1' for localhost or any
              value returned by LocalIPList.
              Replaced loadtime import for ntohs and getpeername by runtime
              load.
              Revised check for dotted numeric IP address in WSocketResolveHost
              to allow correct handling of hostnames beginning by a digit.
              Added OnSendData event. Triggered each time data has been sent
              to winsock. Do not confuse with OnDataSent which is triggered
              when TWSocket internal buffer is emptyed. This event has been
              suggested by Paul Gertzen" <pgertzen@livetechnology.com> to
              easyly implement progress bar.
              Corrected WSocketGetHostByAddr to make it dynamically link to
              winsock.
Sep 5, 1999   V4.09 Added CloseDelayed method.
              Make sure that TriggerSessionClosed is called from WMASyncSelect
              and InternalClose, even if there is no OnSessionClosed event
              handler assigned. This is required to make derived components
              work correctly.
              Created message WM_TRIGGER_EXCEPTION to help checking background
              exception handling (OnBgException event).
              Corrected bug for Delphi 1 and ReallocMem.
Oct 02, 1999  V4.10 Added Release method.
Oct 16, 1999  V4.11 Corrected a bug in TCustomLineWSocket.DoRecv: need to move
              data in front of buffer instead of changing buffer pointer which
              will crash the whole thing at free time.
Oct 23, 1999  V4.12 Made WSocketIsDottedIP a public function
Nov 12, 1999  V4.13 removed 3 calls to TriggerSocksAuthState because it was
                    called twice. By A. Burlakov <alex@helexis.com>.
Jan 24, 1999  V4.14 Call Receive instead of DoRecv from ReceiveStr to be sure
              to set LastError correctly. Thanks to Farkas Balazs
              <megasys@www.iridium.hu>
              Suppressed FDllName and used winsocket constant directly. I had
              troubles with some DLL code and string handling at program
              termination.
Apr 09, 2000 V4.15 Added error number when resolving proto and port
Apr 29, 2000 V4.16 Added WSocketForceLoadWinsock and
             WSocketCancelForceLoadWinsock. Thanks to Steve Williams.
             Created variable FSelectEvent to store current async event mask.
             Added ComponentOptions property with currently only one options
             wsoNoReceiveLoop which disable a receive loop in AsyncReceive.
             This loop breaking was suggested by Davie <smatters@smatters.com>
             to lower resource usage with really fast LAN and large transfers.
             By default, this option is disabled so there is no change needed
             in current code.
May 20, 2000 V4.17 Made TSocket = u_int (same def as in winsock.pas)
             Moved bind after setting options.
             Thanks to Primoz Gabrijelcic <fab@siol.net>
Jul 15, 2000 V4.18 Alon Gingold <gingold@hiker.org.il> changed
             TCustomSocksWSocket calls to inherited triggers of
             TriggerSessionConnected and TriggerDataAvailable.
             Now, it calls the trigger directly. This solves the problem
             of descendent classes with overridden triggers, not being
             called when a REAL connection was established, and when real
             data starts coming in. Special care MUST be taken in such
             overridden triggers to ONLY call the inherited trigger AND
             IMMEDIATELY EXIT when FSocksState <> socksData to avoid loopback
Jul 22, 2000 V4.19 John Goodwin <john@jjgoodwin.com> found a failure in the
             logic for DnsLookup. He also implemented a workaround.
             See DnsLookup comments for explanation.
Aug 09, 2000 V4.20 Alon Gingold <gingold2@mrm-multicat.com> found a bug in
             SOCKS4 implementation where a nul byte was incorrectly added
             (it should be added only with SOCKS4A version, not straith
             SOCKS4).
Sep 17, 2000 V4.21 Eugene Mayevski <Mayevski@eldos.org> added TWndMethod for
             NOFORMS applications in other components.
Oct 15, 2000 V4.22 Added method GetXAddr which returns local IP address to
             which a socket has been bound. There was already a GetXPort.
             Thanks to Wilfried Mestdagh <wilfried_sonal@compuserve.com>
             and Steve Williams <stevewilliams@kromestudios.com>.
Nov 08, 2000 V4.23 Moved FSelectEvent from private to protected section.
Nov 11, 2000 V4.24 Added LineLimit property and OnLineLimitExceeded event.
             When using line mode, line length is checked as each data block is
             comming. If the length is greater than the limit, then the event
             is triggered. You have the opportunity to close the socket or
             change the limit to a higher value. Thus you can prevent a hacker
             from locking your system by sending unlimited line which otherwise
             would eat up all system resources.
             Changed line handling variables to LongInt
             Checked all length involved in StrPCopy calls.
Nov 26, 2000 V4.25 Do not trust GetRcvdCount. Always call Receive to check for
             incomming data (sometime NT4 will hang if we don't do that).
Jan 24, 2001 V4.26 Blaine R Southam <bsoutham@iname.com> fixed out of bound
             error in TCustomLineWSocket.TriggerDataAvailable
Feb 17, 2001 V4.27 Davie <smatters@smatters.com> fixed a bug causing byte lost
             when closing (related to wsoNoReceiveLoop option).
May 04, 2001 V4.28 Fixed W2K bug (winsock message ordering)
Jun 18, 2001 V4.29 Added AllocateHWnd and DeallocateHWnd from Forms unit to
             avoid warning from Delphi 6 in all other components.
Jul 08, 2001 V4.30 Fixed small bug related to NOFOMRS and V4.29
Jul 26, 2001 V4.31 Checked csDesigning in GetRcvdCount so that Delphi 6 does'nt
             crash when object inspector wants to display RcvdCount value.
             Added multicast capability and UDP ReuseAddr. Thanks to Mark
             G. Lewis <Lewis@erg.sri.com> for his code.
             Added TriggerSessionClosed to SocketError as suggested by Wilfried
             Mestdagh <wilfried_sonal@compuserve.com>
Jul 28, 2001 V4.32 New option wsoTcpNoDelay implemented. Code by Arnaldo Braun
             <abraun@th.com.br>
Jul 30, 2001 V4.33 Corrected at few glitches with Delphi 1
Sep 08, 2001 V4.34 Added ThreadAttach and related functions
Nov 27, 2001 V4.35 Added type definition for in_addr and Delphi 2 (Yes there are
             still some peoples who wants to use it. Don't ask me why !).
Dec 02, 2001 V4.36 david.brock2@btinternet.com found a bug in SOCKS4 where
             error check incorrectly checked "FRcvBuf[1] = #$90" instead of
             "FRcvBuf[1] <> #90". He also found a bug when receiving domain name
             where length of name was incorrectly copyed to the buffer.
Dec 23, 2001 V4.37 Removed bWrite, nMoreCnt, bMoreFlag and nMoreMax which where
             not more really used. Thanks to Al Kirk <akirk@pacific.net> for
             showing that.
Feb 24, 2002 V4.38 Wilfried Mestdagh <wilfried@mestdagh.biz> added ThreadDetach
             and a property editor for LineEnd. XSocketDeallocateHWnd made a
             function.
             I created a new unit WSocketE.pas to put Wilfried's property
             editor so that it works correctly with Delphi 6.
Apr 24, 2002 V4.39 Removed OnLineTooLong event which was not used anywhere.
             Use OnLineLimitExceeded event if you used this event.
             Thanks to Alex Kook <cookis@mail.ru> for finding this one.
Apr 27, 2002 V4.40 Added procedure WSocketUnregisterClass to be able to
             unregister hidden window. This is necessary when TWSocket is
             used within a DLL which is unloaded and reloaded by applications,
             specially when running with Windows-XP. Thanks to Jean-Michel Aliu
             <jmaliu@jmasoftware.com> who provided a test case.
Jun 02, 2002 V4.41 allow SOCK_RAW in Connect method for any protocol which is
             not TCP or UDP. Thanks to Holger Lembke <holger@hlembke.de>.
Jun 04, 2002 V4.42 Do not call Listen for SOCK_RAW.
             Thanks to Holger Lembke <holger@hlembke.de>.
Jun 08, 2002 V4.43 Add a dummy Register procedure for BCB1.
             Thanks to Marc-Alexander Prowe <listen@mohajer.de>.
Jul 07, 2002 V4.44 Added code in Connect method to check if socket still opened
             after OnChangeState event. If not, trigger an error WSAINVAL.
Sep 16, 2002 V4.45 Exposed RcvdPtr and RcvdCnt readonly properties.
Sep 17, 2002 V4.46 Used InterlockedIncrement/InterlockedDecrement to Inc/Dec
             socket count safely when TWSocket is used within a thread. This
             was proposed by Matthew Meadows <matthew.meadows@inquisite.com>
Sep 28, 2002 V4.47 Changed DnsLookup so that a hostname is checked for dotted
             IP addresse and resolve it numerically. Thanks to Bogdan Calin
             <soul4blade@yahoo.com> who found this bug. Alos loaded the result
             list with the address to be consistant with real lookup result.
Nov 17, 2002 V4.48 Roland Klabunde <roland.klabunde@gmx.net> found a bug in
             multicast code: listening on a specific interface was ignored.
             He fixed Listen and Connect.
Nov 27, 2002 V4.49 Added ListenBacklog property, default to 5.
Dec 17, 2002 V4.50 Moved code to virtual function to permit SSL implementation.
Jan 19, 2003 V5.00 First pre-release for ICS-SSL. New major version number
             V5.01 Gabi Slonto <buffne01@gmx.net> found a bug in DnsLookup
             when hostname was actulally a dotted IP address.
Mar 18, 2003 V5.02 Fixed WSocketIsDottedIP: reordering of boolean expressions
             involaving a string. Thanks to Ian Baker <ibaker@codecutters.org>
Apr 30, 2003 V5.03 Replaced all calls to setsockopt by calls to
             WSocket_setsockopt to avoid statically linked winsock DLL.
             Thanks to Piotr Dalek <enigmatical@interia.pl>.
             Also replaced inet_addr by WSocket_inet_addr.
Aug 27, 2003 V5.04 Marco van de Voort <marcov@stack.nl> added FreePascal (FPC)
             conditional compilation. Please contact him for any FPC support
             question.
Aug 28, 2003 V5.05 Fixed a multithreading issue related to windows class
             registration. Now using a critical section around the code.
             Thanks to Bogdan Ureche <bureche@omnivex.com> for his precious help.
Aug 31, 2003 V5.06 Added warning about deprecated procedures Synchronize,
             WaitUntilReady and ReadLine. Do not use them in new applications.
Sep 03, 2003 V5.07 Bogdan Ureche <bureche@omnivex.com> added a critical section
             to avoid problem when winsock.dll is unloaded by a thread while
             another thread is still using some TWSocket.
Sep 15, 2003 V5.08 Fixed finalization section to no free critical section if
             a TWSocket is still existing. This happend for example when a
             TWSocket is on a form and Halt is called from FormCreate event.
             Changed SendStr argument to const.
Nov 09, 2003 V5.09 Added manifest constants for Shutdown
             Added TCustomLineWSocket.SendLine method.
Jan 16, 2004 V5.10 Added "const" in front of all method using strings.
Jan 17, 2004 V5.11 Modified TriggerDataAvailable so that when in LineMode, we
             check if a line is still in the buffer of already received data.
             Also updated WMTriggerDataAvailable to avoid infinite loops.
             Introduced FLineFound to flag when a line has been found.
             See "OLD_20040117" to find this code.
Jan 21, 2004 V5.12 Checked null string in PutStringInSendBuffer and null
             pointer in PutDataInSendBuffer.
Jan 26, 2004 V5.13 Conditional compilation for BCB for constants for Shutdown.
             Reordered uses clause for FPC compatibility.
             Fixed TCustomLineWSocket.TriggerDataAvailable to deliver data
             already received while in line mode but after component user
             turned line mode off in the middle of the way. This could occur
             for example in a HTTP application where line mode is used to
             receive HTTP header line and turned off when last header line is
             found. At that point, if posted data (HTTP document) was completely
             in the same packet as the last header line, that data was not
             delivered until the next packet comes, which could never occur !
Mar 20, 2004 V5.14 Added partial support for RAW socket.
             To use RAW sockets, set Proto to 'raw_ip', 'raw_icmp', ...
             Set Port to '0' or whatever value is useful for the protocol.
             When using IP protocol, you can add option wsoSIO_RCVALL so that
             your program receive ALL datagrams when you listen on a given
             interface (You can't use 0.0.0.0).
             Do not use Connect with RAW socket. Always use Listen and then
             use SendTo to send datagrams use the socket.
             Added ReqVerHigh and ReqVerLow properties to be able to select
             which winsock version you want to load. Default to 1.1 but need
             2.2 for RAW sockets to be used.
Mar 24, 2004 V5.15 Changed WSocket_Synchronized_ResolveProto to hard code
             protocol number for tcp, udp and raw.
Apr 17, 2004 V6.00 New major release started. Move all platform and runtime
             dependencies to separate units. New base component for handling
             component with window handle.
Jun 20, 2004 V 5.16 John Mulvey <john@mulvey.eurobell.co.uk> fixed error message
             in GetPeerAddr which incorrectly reported an error about
             GetPeerName.
May 23, 2005 V5.17 PutDataInSendBuffer set bAllSent to false.
Jun 03, 2005 V5.18 Added SocketSndBufSize property which gives the size of
             winsock internal send buffer. When using TCP, you must make sure
             you never use a BufSize equal or greater than this value or
             you'll experience bad performances. See description in MSDN
             http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;823764
             Default value for BufSize is 1460 and SocketSndBufSize is 8192 so
             there is no problem when not changing those values.
Jun 18, 2005 V5.19 Made TCustomSocksWSocket.Connect accept 'tcp' as well as '6'
             for protocol. By Piotr "Hellrayzer" Dalek.
             Renamed event OnDisplay to OnDebugDisplay.
Sept 4, 2005 V5.20 added BufferedByteCount property used to ensure winsock has sent
             data, currently used in TFtpCli to check a put has finished correctly
             Thanks to Tobias Giesen <tobias@tgtools.de> for the fix
Dec 27, 2005 V6.00a Updated new release with change done in the old release.
Dec 31, 2005 V6.00b added new debug and logging event and log levels, replacing
             conditional debug code with optional code to avoid rebuilding apps.
             Works in combination with new component TIcsLogger.
             This is controlled by the new LogOptions property:
               loDestEvent - write to OnIcsLogEvent (called from higher level protocols)
               loDestFile - write to file debug_out.myprog.txt
               loDestOutDebug - write to OutputDebugString (shown in Debugger Event Log window)
               loAddStamp - time stamp each log line (accurate only to about 18ms)
               loWsockErr - log wsocket errors
               loWsockInfo - log wsocket general information
               loWsockDump - log wsocket data (not implemented yet)
               loSslErr - log SSL errors
               loSslInfo - log SSL general information
               loSslDump - log SSL packets and data
               loProtSpecErr - log protocol specific error
               loProtSpecInfo - log protocol specific general information
               loProtSpecDump - log protocol specific data and packets
Jan 22, 2006 V6.00c Added some KeepAlive stuff (seems winsock is bugged and
             doesn't care any setting done !).
Jan 28, 2006 V6.00d Gerhard Rattinger fixed SetKeepAliveOption for Delphi 3
Mar 09, 2006 V6.00e Arno made properties to select keepalive parameters.
             He also fixed ReverseDnsLookup to return a list of
             host names (aliases) instead of just the first entry. Added func.
             ReverseDnsLookupSync.
Apr 27, 2006 V6.00f Roger Tinembart <tinembart@brain.ch> added a critical section
             around the list of sendbuffers (FBufHandler) to avoid problems when
             the data is placed in the sendbuffer (for example with SendStr)
             by a different thread than the one that is effectively sending the
             data with TryToSend
June 11, 2006 V6.01 Use new TIcsBufferHandler.
Aug 06, 2006 V6.02 Angus added GetWinsockErr to give alpha and numeric winsock
             errors and improved many other error messages,
             and fixed FReadCount for 64-bit downloads
             added some EXTERNALSYM for BCB compatiblity
Aug 18, 2006 V6.03 Fixed a bug in ASyncReceive(). This bug caused data loss.
Oct 28, 2006 V6.04 Added setter for SocketSndBufSize and SocketRcvBufSize
Dec 22, 2006 V6.05 Oliver Grahl fixed SendLine to properly count LineEnd characters.
Jan 18, 2007 V6.06 Fixed constructor and DeleteBufferedData to behave correctly
             when an exception occur in AllocateSocketHWnd.
Mar 23, 2007 V6.07 Removed FD_CONNECT from dup().
Apr 04, 2007 V6.08 Arno Garrels updated SetKeepAliveOption
Mar 10, 2008 V6.09 Francois Piette & Arno Garrels made some changes to
                   prepare code for Unicode
                   WSocket_gethostname conversion from String to AnsiString
                   WSocketGetProc and WSocket2GetProc use AnsiString
                   GetAliasList simplified and use AnsiString
Apr 25, 2008 V6.10 A. Garrels, added some getters/setters to store and use some
             string-property-values as AnsiString internally.
             This reduced number of string casts with potential data loss to 17.
             These ansi-values are used to call winsock API that doesn't provide
             W functions. Modified depending code including some type changes
             from PChar to PAnsiChar. Made some casts Unicode => Ansi with
             potential data loss *explicit* casts (conditionally compiled) some
             unicode strings with only 7 bit ASCII characters are casted using
             new function UnicodeToAscii() in new unit OverbyteIcsUtils which
             should be fast and reliable and doesn't produce compiler warnings.
             Added new warning symbols.
Apr 30, 2008 V6.11 A. Garrels - Function names adjusted according to changes in
             OverbyteIcsLibrary.pas.
May 11, 2008 V6.12 USchuster removed local atoi implementation (atoi is now in
             OverbyteIcsUtils.pas)
May 15, 2008 V6.13 AGarrels type change of some published String properties
             to AnsiString, this is an attempt to avoid too many implicit
             string casts, only a few higher level components have been adjusted
             accordingly so far.
Jun 30, 2008 A.Garrels made some changes to prepare SSL code for Unicode.
Jul 04, 2008 V6.11 Rev.58 SSL - Still lacked a few changes I made last year.
Jul 13, 2008 V6.12 Added SafeWSocketGCount
Aug 03, 2008 V6.16 A. Garrels removed packed from record TExtension.
Jul 07, 2008 V6.17 Still a small fix from December 2007 missing in SSL code.
Aug 11, 2008 V6.18 A. Garrels - Type AnsiString rolled back to String.
             Two bugs fixed in SSL code introduced with Unicode change.
             Socks was not fully prepared for Unicode.
Sep 19, 2008 V6.19 A. Garrels changed some AnsiString types to RawByteString.
Sep 21, 2008 V6.20 A. Garrels removed BoolToStr(), available since D7
Oct 22, 2008 V7.21 A. Garrels removed the const modifier from parameter Data
             in function SendTo to fix a bug in C++ Builder.
Nov 03, 2008 V7.22 Added property Counter, a class reference to TWSocketCounter
             which provides some useful automatic counters. By default property
             Counter is unassigned and has to be enabled by a call to
             CreateCounter.
Apr 24, 2009 V7.23 A. Garrels added *experimental* OpenSSL engine support which
             is not compiled in by default. You have to uncomment conditional
             define OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE in OverbyteIcsSslDefs.inc and rebuild your
             packages to get it included. With engine support included a new
             published property AutoEnableBuiltinEngines of TSslContext has to
             be set to TRUE in order to enable OpenSSL's built-in hardware
             accelerators support, that's all.

             ******************************************************************
             * Due to the lack of hardware this feature is completely untested*
             ******************************************************************

             Any feedback and fixes are welcome, please contact the ICS mailing
             list. The OpenSSL engine documentation can be found here:
             http://openssl.org/docs/crypto/engine.html

             Additionally a new component TSslEngine is installed on the palette.
             Its purpose is to control (dynamic) engines.

             Typically control commands of an OpenSC dynamic pkcs11 engine
             (SmartCard) are :

             Cmds.Add('SO_PATH=d:\opensc\bin\engine_pkcs11.dll');
             Cmds.Add('ID=pkcs11');
             Cmds.Add('LIST_ADD=1');
             Cmds.Add('LOAD=');
             Cmds.Add('MODULE_PATH=d:\opensc\bin\opensc-pkcs11.dll');
             Cmds.Add('INIT='); <= Special ICS-control command to initialize the engine

             Sample test code (Dod couldn't get it working :(

             It assumes that the X509 certificate has been exported from
             the SmartCard to PEM file that is available in property
             SslCertFile. It's also assumed that SslEngine1 is created
             dynamically at run-time in this sample.
             We are in new event TSslContext.OnBeforeInit:

             if not Assigned(SslEngine1) then
             begin
                SslEngine1 := TSslEngine.Create(Self);
                try
                  SslEngine1.NameID := 'dynamic';

                  // The SmartCard holds the private key.
                  // Next two lines advise SslContext to load the key
                  // from the engine instead from PEM file.
                  TSslContext(Sender).CtxEngine := SslEngine1;
                  SslEngine1.CtxCapabilities := [eccLoadPrivKey];

                  // The PIN code is expected in property SslPassPhrase
                  TSslContext(Sender).SslPassPhrase := 'ics';

                  // Tell the engine which key to use.
                  SslEngine1.KeyID := KeyIdEdit.Text;

                  // At first open the engine
                  if not SslEngine1.Open then
                      raise Exception.Create(FEngine.LastErrorMsg);

                  // Now send our vendor specific control commands
                  for I := 0 to Cmds.Count -1 do
                  begin
                    if not SslEngine1.Control(Cmds.Names[I],
                                              Cmds.ValueFromIndex[I]) then
                        raise Exception.Create(SslEngine1.LastErrorMsg);
                  end;

                  Display('Engine set up and loaded successfully');
                except
                    FreeAndNil(SslEngine1);
                    raise;
                end;
             end;

Jun 12, 2009 V7.24 Angus added WriteCount property, how many bytes sent since
                     connection opened
                   Only reset ReadCount when connection opened, not closed
Jul 16, 2009 V7.25 Arno fixed and changed SetCounterClass()
Jul 19, 2009 V7.26 Arno - SSL code ignored FPaused flag, the change is in
                   TCustomSslWSocket.TriggerEvent.
Sep 04, 2009 V7.27 Set option TCP_NODELAY in Dup as well as provide a public
                   method to set this option, similar as suggested by
                   Samuel Soldat.
Sep 08, 2009 V7.28 Arno - Minor Unicode bugfix in TX509Base.GetExtension().
Sep 09, 2009 V7.29 Arno - Added new public methods TX509Base.WriteToBio() and
                   TX509Base.ReadFromBio(). Method SafeToPemFile got an arg.
                   that adds human readable certificate text to the output.
                   InitializeSsl inlined. Removed a Delphi 1 conditional.
Sep 17, 2009 V7.30 Anton Sviridov optimized setting of SSL options.
Sep 17, 2009 V7.31 Arno fixed a Unicode bug in TX509Base.GetExtension and
                   a general bug in TX509Base.GetSha1Hash (AnsiString as
                   digest buffer should really be avoided)
Sep 18, 2009 V7.32 Arno changed visibility of TX509Base.WriteToBio() and
                   TX509Base.ReadFromBio() to protected.
Nov 01, 2009 V7.33 Arno fixed a memory overwrite bug in
                   TCustomSocksWSocket.DoRecv().
Nov 07, 2009 V7.34 OpenSSL V0.9.8L disables session renegotiation due to
                   TLS renegotiation vulnerability.
Dec 20, 2009 V7.35 Arno added support for SSL Server Name Indication (SNI).
                   SNI has to be turned on in OverbyteIcsSslDefs.inc, see define
                   "OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT". Exchanged symbol "NO_ADV_MT" in the
                   SSL source by "NO_SSL_MT" (This and SNI was sponsored by
                   Fastream Technologies).
                   SNI Howto: In SSL server mode assign event OnSslServerName,
                   it triggers whenever a client sent a server name in the TLS
                   client helo. From the event handler read public property
                   SslServerName, lookup and pass a matching, valid and
                   initialized SslContext instance associated with the server name.
                   In SSL client mode, if property SslServerName was not empty
                   this server name is sent to the server in the TLS client helo.
                   Currently IE 7 and FireFox >= V2 support SNI, note that both
                   browers don't send both "localhost" and IP addresses as
                   server names, this is specified in RFC.
Dec 24, 2009 V7.36 SSL SNI - Do not switch context if not initialized.
Dec 26, 2009 V7.37 Arno fixed TCustomSyncWSocket.ReadLine for Unicode. It
                   now takes an AnsiString buffer. Since this method is highly
                   deprecated it's also marked as "deprecated". Do not use it
                   in new applications.
May 08, 2010 V7.38 Arno Garrels added support for OpenSSL 0.9.8n. Read comments
                   in OverbyteIcsLIBEAY.pas for details.
May 16, 2010 V7.39 Arno Garrels reenabled check for nil in WMAsyncGetHostByName.
Jun 10, 2010 V7.40 Arno Garrels added experimental timeout and throttle feature
                   to TWSocket. Currently both features have to be enabled
                   explicitly with conditional defines BUILTIN_TIMEOUT
                   and/or BUILTIN_THROTTLE (see OverbyteIcsDefs.inc )
Aug 02, 2010 V7.41 Arno removed an option to send plain UTF-16 strings with
                   SendStr() and SendLine() by passing 1200 (CP_UTF16) in the
                   codepage parameter. Changed SendLine() to return correct
                   number of bytes written.
Aug 08, 2010 V7.42 FPiette prevented socket close in TCustomWSocket.Destroy when
                   socket state is wsInvalidState (this happend when an
                   exception is raise early in the constructor).
Sep 05, 2010 V7.43 Arno fixed a bug in the experimental throttle and timeout
                   source which made it impossible to use both features at the
                   same time. Renamed conditionals EXPERIMENTAL_THROTTLE and
                   EXPERIMENTAL_TIMEOUT to BUILTIN_THROTTLE and BUILTIN_TIMEOUT.
                   It's now possible to either enable them in OverbyteIcsDefs.inc
                   or define them in project options.
Sep 08, 2010 V7.44 Arno reworked the experimental timeout and throttle code.
                   Method names of TCustomTimeoutWSocket **changed**, they all
                   got prefix "Timeout". Removed the crappy TCustomTimerWSocket
                   class, both throttle and timeout use their own TIcsThreadTimer
                   instance now.
Sep 08, 2010 V7.45 Fixed a typo in experimental throttle code.
Sep 11, 2010 V7.46 Arno added two more SSL debug log entries and a call to
                   RaiseLastOpenSslError in TCustomSslWSocket.InitSSLConnection.
                   Added function OpenSslErrMsg.
Sep 23, 2010 V7.47 Arno fixed a bug in the experimental throttle code and made
                   it more accurate. Thanks to Angus for testing and reporting.
                   Method Resume with SSL enabled did not always work.
Oct 10, 2010 V7.48 Arno - MessagePump changes/fixes.
Oct 14, 2010 V7.49 Arno - Abort TCustomLineWSocket as soon as possible.
Oct 15, 2010 V7.50 Arno - Made function IsSslRenegotiationDisallowed available.
Oct 16, 2010 V7.51 Arno removed dummy ancestor TBaseParentWSocket, it was not
                   required to make D7's structure view happy.
Nov 08, 2010 V7.52 Arno improved final exception handling, more details
                   in OverbyteIcsWndControl.pas (V1.14 comments).
Dec 06, 2010 V7.53 Arno added thread-safe TSslContext.FreeNotification and
                   TSslContext.RemoveFreeNotification.
Dec 07, 2010 V7.54 Arno - TSslBaseComponent, thread-safe removal of IcsLogger's
                   free notification.
Feb 04, 2011 V7.55 Angus - allow BandwidthLimit to be changed during connection
Feb 09, 2011 V7.56 Arno added HTTP V1.1 transparent proxy support including
                   Basic and NTLM authentication implemented as
                   TCustomHttpTunnelWSocket. This feature is still in beta
                   state, mainly because I only tested against WinGate proxy
                   server. My goal was to make it as fast as possible, there
                   are no or just very few protected methods available to
                   override so far. Best performance is achieved with one of the
                   authentication types "htatNone", "htatBasic" or "htatNtlm".
                   With "htatDetect" the last successful authentication type is
                   cached until the proxy server name changes or the TWSocket
                   object is freed.
Feb 09, 2011 V7.57 Arno added public property HttpTunnelLastResponse to
                   TCustomHttpTunnelWSocket. HTTP status codes are no longer
                   triggered as is but added to a base of global const
                   "ICS_HTTP_TUNNEL_BASEERR".
Feb 13, 2011 V7.58 Arno - HTTP tunnel accepts LF as end-of-line marker.
                   In both SOCKS and HTTP tunnel trigger an error from
                   SessionClosed if the proxy drops the connection unexpectedly.
                   New functions to get error messages from error codes.
                   WSocketHttpTunnelErrorDesc, WSocketSocksErrorDesc
                   WSocketProxyErrorDesc, WSocketErrorMsgFromErrorCode
                   WSocketGetErrorMsgFromErrorCode. The latter two are general
                   purpose functions that currently try to translate winsock and
                   proxy error codes to string.
Feb 14, 2011 V7.59 Arno - SessionConnected triggered twice when a connection to
                   proxy could not be established, introduced in V7.58.
                   Added function WSocketIsProxyErrorCode(): Boolean.
Feb 14, 2011 V7.60 Arno - SOCKS4/SOCKS4A Unicode bug fixed in
                   TCustomSocksWSocket.SocksDoConnect.
Feb 15, 2011 V7.61 Arno - Workaround a false version number (5) in WinGate's
                   SOCKS5 authentication response when user credentials are
                   wrong (reports an authentication error now rather than a
                   SOCKS version error). WSocketProxyErrorDesc and
                   WSocketGetErrorMsgFromErrorCode added a hyphen as separator
                   to the message. Removed a string cast warning.
Feb 16, 2011 V7.62 Arno fixed a memory overwrite bug in TCustomHttpTunnelWSocket
                   DataAvailable. Improved keep-alive handling and removed the
                   hard check for correct HTTP version. It still supports
                   HTTP/1.1 only, however is now partly compatible with 3Proxy.
                   It has been tested successfully with WinGate, Sambar,
                   Fastream IQ Proxy Server and 3Proxy. Note that detection of
                   authentication type works only with persistent connections,
                   with 3Proxy you have to explicitly set the authentication type.
Feb 20, 2011 V7.63 Arno added digest authentication to TCustomHttpTunnelWSocket.
                   Define "NO_HTTP_TUNNEL_AUTHDIGEST" to exclude it from a build,
                   so far it's tested with ICS-based IQ Proxy Server only. Some
                   new property setters.
Feb 21, 2011 V7.64 Arno - New ComponentOption "wsoNoHttp10Tunnel" treats HTTP/1.0
                   responses as errors. If "wsoNoHttp10Tunnel" is not set send
                   "Keep-Alive" header with NTLM message #1 in order to make
                   HTTP/1.0 proxies happy (MS Proxy Server 2.0 tested).
Feb 26, 2011 V7.65 Arno - TCustomHttpTunnelWSocket strongly improved.
                 - Bugfix: Ensure that internally buffered application data
                   is read by the upper layer by posting a fake FD_READ message
                   if required.
                 - Better support of HTTP/1.0 proxies.
                 - Performs an internal reconnect when the connection has to
                   be closed after a 407 status code and the server provides a
                   supported authentication method, as a result htatDetect
                   works with non-persistent connections as well.
                 - Tested with Squid 2.7.STABLE8 for Windows successfully.
                 - Tested with CSM proxy 4.2 successfully after adding a
                   workaround (requires at least two header lines being sent).
                 - ISA Server 2006 tested successfully except with digest auth.
                   I wasn't able to get digest authentication working neither IE
                   nor Firefox got authenticated. Interesting is that ISA uses
                   digest algorithm "MD5-sess" that I enabled in
                   OverbyteIcsDigestAuth.pas now, untested!
Feb 28, 2011 V7.66 Arno - TCustomHttpTunnelWSocket bugfix, do not explicitly
                   close the connection in HttpTunnelTriggerResultOrContinue
                   when FD_CLOSE notification from winsock has been received yet.
Feb 28, 2011 V7.67 Arno - TCustomHttpTunnelWSocket HttpTunnelGetNtlmMessage3,
                   send challenge domain name only if user code doesn't
                   include one.
Mar 16, 2011 V7.68 Anton S. added two debug messages.
Mar 21, 2011 V7.69 Method Abort no longer triggers an exception nor event OnError
                   if a call to winsock API WSACancelAsyncRequest in method
                   CancelDnsLookup failed for some reason.
Apr 10, 2011 V7.70 Arno added property SslVerifyFlags to the TSslContext. This enables
                   the component user to include certificate revocation lists (CRL)
                   added thru SslCRLFile and SslCRLPath in the certificate verification
                   process. However enabling CRL-checks needs some additional
                   action in the OnSslVerifyPeer event since OpenSSL will the
                   trigger any error related to CRLs. If there's, for instance,
                   no CRL available or it has expired etc.. You find the possible
                   error codes in OverbyteIcsLibeay.pas search i.e. for
                   X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_CRL.
Apr 15, 2011 V7.71 Arno prepared for 64-bit.
Apr 21, 2011 V7.72 Éric Fleming Bonilha found a bug in SetSocketRcvBufSize.
Apr 23, 2011 V7.73 Arno added support for OpenSSL 0.9.8r and 1.0.0d.
Apr 24, 2011 V7.74 Arno fixed compatibility with OpenSSL 1.0.0d.
Apr 26, 2011 V7.75 Anton S. found that TrashCanSize was not set correctly in
                   non .NET environments, only important if OnDataAvailable
                   is not assigned with non-listening sockets, which should
                   never be the case.
May 03, 2011 V7.76 Arno improved error messages on loading OpenSSL libs.
                   Added method Insert to TX509List. Removed a few useless
                   type casts.
May 08, 2011 v7.77 Arno added TX509List.SortChain and use of new function
                   f_ERR_remove_thread_state(nil) with OpenSSL v1.0.0+
May 11, 2011 v7.78 Arno made the SSL peer certificate available as property
                   TSslWSocket.SslPeerCert. The SslPeerCert is instantiated
                   lazily once and usable after a SSL handshake including
                   the SSL session was reused from cache until the next SSL
                   connection is initialized. It is usable when SslPeerCert.X508
                   is non-nil. In previous versions the PeerCert passed to
                   OnSslHandshakeDone could be just a reference to one of the
                   certs in the SslCertChain which was eval.
May 17, 2011 v7.79 Arno added Sha1Hex, Sha1Digest, IssuedBy, IssuerOf and
                   SelfSigned to TX509Base. Deprecated Sha1Hash since it was
                   buggy storing binary in strings. Return values of Sha1Hex
                   and Sha1Digest are cached. Reworked TX509List and added new
                   methods.
Jun 08, 2011 v7.80 Arno added x64 assembler routines, untested so far.
Jun 18, 2011 v7.81 aguser removed some compiler hints.

May 21, 2011 V7.82 Arno - Make sure receipt of a SSL shutdown notification
                   closes the connection if no bidirectional SSL shutdown is
                   wanted. There are servers in the wild expecting a SSL
                   shutdown confirmation before they close the connection.
Jul 22, 2011 V7.83 Arno - OEM NTLM changes.
Sep 26, 2011 V7.84 Angus - Set SocketSndBufSize and SocketRcvBufSize for
                   Listen sockets, note only worth increasing sizes for UDP
Feb 17, 2012 V7.86 Arno added NTLMv2 and NTLMv2 session security (basics),
                   read comment "HowTo NTLMv2" in OverbyteIcsNtlmMsgs.pas.
Apr 30, 2012 V7.87 Arno - Some SSL debug log strings adjusted.
May 2012 - V8.00 - Arno added FireMonkey cross platform support with POSIX/MacOS
                   also IPv6 support, include files now in sub-directory
                   added property SocketFamily, sfAny = System default preference,
                     sfAnyIPv4 = IPv4 preference, sfAnyIPv6 = IPv6 preference,
                     sfIPv4 = explicit IPv4, sfIPv6 = explicit IPv6.
                   added functions WSocketIPv4ToStr, WSocketIPv6ToStr,
                     WSocketStrToIPv4, WSocketStrToIPv6, WSocketStrToMappedIPv4,
                     WSocketIsIPv4, WSocketIsIP (finds SocketFamily from string)
Aug 5, 2012 V8.01 - Angus added WSocketIsIPEx (finds SocketFamily from string,
                     including AnyIPv4/IPv6), added SocketFamilyNames
Feb 16. 2013 V8.02 Angus - WSocketResolveIp no exception for IPv6 lookups
Mar 16, 2013 V8.03 Arno added new property LocalAddr6. This is a breaking change
                   if you ever assigned some IPv6 to property LocalAddr in
                   existing code. LocalAddr6 should be assigned a local IPv6,
                   LocalAddr should be assigned a local IPv4, provided it is
                   actually required to bind the socket to a particular interface.
                   By default both properties LocalAddr and LocalAddr6 do not
                   require a value.
Jun 03, 2013 V8.04 FPiette added unit "Types" so that some inlines are
                   expanded.
Jun 03, 2013 V8.05 Eric Fleming Bonilha found a serious bug with closing the
                   socket. The problem was that winsock may continue to post
                   notification messages after closesocket() has been called.
Aug 18, 2013 V8.06 Arno added some default property specifiers.
Oct 22. 2013 V8.07 Angus - Added SendTo6 and ReceiveFrom6 for IPv6 UDP
Dec 24. 2013 V8.08 Francois - fixed range check error in various PostMessages
Feb 12, 2014 V8.09 Angus - fixed TX509Base.PostConnectionCheck to check multiple
                   DNS or IP entries
Jul 9, 2014  V8.10 Angus - added sslCiphersXXX literals some taken from Mozilla
                   with much higher security for servers
Aug 15, 2014 V8.11 Angus made WriteCount public in descendent components
Oct 20, 2014 V8.12 Angus added sslCiphersMozillaSrvInter which excludes SSLv3
Nov 8,  2014 V8.13 Eugene Kotlyarov added namespace for all RTL units for XE2 and
                    later, note only this unit has bumped version
Dec 11, 2014 V8.14 Angus made LastOpenSslErrMsg public for better error reporting (dump=true)
                   Added SslHandshakeRespMsg with friendly error or success message
                   Added SslHandshakeErr with full SSL error code (event error is reason only)
                   Added SslCipherDesc with OpenSsl long cipher description
                   Added SslEncryption, SslKeyExchange and SslMessAuth extracted from SslCipherDesc
                   Stop SSL reporting handshaking steps as errors and report real SSL errors
                   Other various SSL error reporting improvements
Mar 16, 2015 V8.15 Angus added more SslOptions: sslOpt_NO_COMPRESSION, sslOpt_TLSEXT_PADDING,
                     sslOpt_SAFARI_ECDHE_ECDSA_BUG, sslOpt_CISCO_ANYCONNECT, sslOpt_NO_TLSv1_1
                     and sslOpt_NO_TLSv1_2
                   Added more SslVersionMethods: sslTLS_V1_1, sslTLS_V1_2 and sslBestVer which
                     is eqivalent to sslV23 and actually means any of SSLV3, TLS1, TLS1.1 or TLS1.2
                   To disable some versions, use sslBestVer and disable specific ones using SslOptions
                   To force only one version, set SslVersionMethod to that version
                   Choosing a specific TLS version will fail if matching Ciphers are not available
                   OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT removed so SSL Server Name Identification is always supported
                   Added SslDHParamFile to load a DH Parameters for Diiffie-Hellman DH and EDH key ciphers
                     DH param files may have key lengths of 512,1024,2048,4096 bits and currently need
                     to be generated using the opensll.exe utility (or use those that come with ICS)
                   Added SslECDHMethod to select Elliptic Curves to support ECDH and EECDH key ciphers
                   Note, only OpenSSL 1.0.1 and later are now supported since this added TLS 1.1/1.2
Mar 26, 2015 V8.16 Angus, the OpenSSL version check is relaxed so minor versions with a letter suffix
                      are now supported up to the next major version, so now support up to 1.0.2z
May 08, 2015 V8.17 Angus, added SslOpt_SINGLE_ECDH_USE
                   check for SslECDHMethodAuto after SSL initialised since need version
Jun 05, 2015 V8.18 Angus, enabled SSL engine support, which are cryptographic modules adding extra algorithms
                   ICS packages are now include OverbyteIcsMsSslUtils and OverbyteIcsSslX509Utils
                     which include certificate display and validation functions, and which were
                     previously only in the SSL samples directory
Oct 25, 2015 V8.19 Angus, version bump only for SSL changes in other units
Nov 3, 2015  V8.20 Angus, SslECDHMethod defaults to sslECDHAuto since web sites are increasingly needing ECDH
                   added two more protocols to sslCiphersMozillaSrvInter according to latest Mozilla update
Nov 23, 2015 V8.21 Eugene Kotlyarov fix MacOSX compilation and compiler warnings
Feb 1, 2016  V8.22 Fixed SSL bug where two consecutive requests from a client would leave a server in
                     a waiting state and not process any other requests, thanks to AviaVox for the fix
Feb 23, 2016 V8.23 Angus, version bump only for changes in other units
Mar 3, 2016  V8.24 Angus, OpenSSL 1.0.2g and 1.0.1s, and later, no longer generally support SSLv2
                   Added define OPENSSL_ALLOW_SSLV2 which must be enabled to allow SSLv2 methods t
                      to be specifically selected for older DLLs or new ones that specifically
                      have SSLv2 support compiled.
                   Don't attempt to set DH, EC and SNI that SSLv2 does not support
Mar 17, 2016  V8.25 Angus, updated sslCiphersMozillaSrvxxx cipher literals to latest versions,
                    but left old versions with suffix 38 for backward compatibility
                    OverbyteIcsSslWebServ1 has cipher menu selection to allow comparison testing
Mar 22, 2016  V8.26 Angus, OnSslServerName event error now defaults to OK instead of
                      ERR_ALERT_WARNING which prevented Java clients connecting with SSL.
May 24, 2016  V8.27 Angus, initial support for OpenSSL 1.1.0, new DLL file names, old exports gone
                    Add public variable GSSLEAY_DLL_IgnoreNew which should be set to TRUE before calling
                      any SSL functions if OpenSSL 1.1.0 should be ignored.  Otherwise libcrypto32.dll
                      found in the PATH will override libeay32.dll in the local directory
                    Added public variable GSSL_BUFFER_SIZE defaults to 16384, previously fixed
                      at 4096, may improve SSL performance if larger
                    Added public variable GSSL_DLL_DIR if set before OpenSSL loaded,
                      will use this directory for DLLs, must have trailing \
                    SslContext adds SslMinVersion and SslMaxVersion properties to
                      specify the minimum and maximum SSL/TLS versions supported from:
                      sslVerSSL3,sslVerTLS1,sslVerTLS1_1,sslVerTLS1_2,sslVerTLS1_3,sslVerMax,
                      note 1.3 is not yet supported.  Although introduced for 1.1.0,
                      these properties have also been implemented for 1.0.1/1.0.2 by
                      internally using Options.  SslVersionMethod is ignored for 1.1.0
                      and SslMinVersion > sslVerSSL3 or SslMaxVersion < sslVerMax.
                   SslContext now allows SSL certificates, private keys, CA bundles and
                      DHParams to be loaded from strings instead of files, allowing
                      them to be saved or created in the application without using any
                      files.  New properties SslCertLines, SslPrivKeyLines, SslCALines
                      and SslDHParamLines allow PEM formatted certificates and keys to
                      be saved with the form or loaded as TStrings.  SslCertLines may
                      be a single certificate or a bundle including one or more
                      intermediates, but must not include the private key.  There
                      are new public methods LoadCertFromString, LoadPKeyFromString,
                      LoadCAFromString and LoadDHParamsFromString that can be used to
                      update the certificates after SslContext is initialised.
                    SslContext has a new method SslGetAllCiphers that returns a multi
                      line list of the ciphers supported by OpenSSL although some may
                      be unusable if the correct protocols,  EC and DHParams are not set.
                    TSslWSocket has a new method SslGetSupportedCiphers (Supported, Remote)
                      that returns a multi line list of ciphers. Supported=True is only for
                      1.1.0 and later and returns the actual ciphers available for the
                      session allowed by the protocols, EC and DHParams.  Remote=True for
                      list received by server from remote client, Remote=False is list
                      supported by client or server. Supported=False is list of all ciphers.
                    Added sslDHParams2048 and sslDHParams4096 constants, the latter is used
                      as SslDHParamLines default so applications support DH and ECDH ciphers
                      without needed a DHParams file.  Still better to generate your own
                      DHParams and load them.
                    Added sslRootCACertsBundle constant as a Root CA Certs Bundle of about
                      30 PEM certificates extracted from Windows 2012 R2 server by
                      OverbyteIcsPemtool, assign this to SslContext.SslCALines.Text to
                      verify remote SSL certificates in client applications, not for servers.
                      This is not used as a default to avoid linking the list unless needed.
                    Many SslOptions are no longer supported for 1.1.0 and are now ignored.
                    Cleaned up SSL initialisation
                    SSL debug logging has been improved by logging SSL certificate
                      subjects when loaded from lines, and logging ciphers when
                      SslContext is initialised.
                    SslECDHMethod is ignored for 1.1.0, always enabled.
                    Various internal SSL changes to accommodate new or removed functions
                       with 1.1.0.
                    X509Base has new methods LoadFromText and PrivateKeyLoadFromText
                      that load a PEM SSL certificate and private key from strings.
May 27, 2016  V8.28 Angus corrected SslMinVersion and SslMaxVersion setting protocols
                      for OSLL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2
                    Debug list all SSL Options
June 26, 2016 V8.29 Angus check for WSAESHUTDOWN in TryToSend and clean close down
                      instead of exception
                    Implement GSSL_DLL_DIR properly to report full file path on error
July 7, 2016  V8.30 Angus corrected FCounter.FLastRecvTick not updated in DoRecvFrom
                       or in SSL DoRecv, and FCounter.FLastSendTick not in SentTo
                       so timeouts did not always work
                    Corrected ReadCount/WriteCount with SSL so xmit no longer includes
                       encryption overhead (recv ignored overhead)
Aug 5, 2016   V8.31 Angus, testing OpenSSL 1.1.0 beta 6
Aug 27, 2016  V8.32 Angus, suuport final release OpenSSL 1.1.0
                    OpenSSL 64-bit DLLs have different file names with -x64 added
                    Fix sslRootCACertsBundle long constant would not compile under
                       C++ Builder, by aplitting smaller and making function
Aug 29, 2016  V8.33 Angus, free GLIBEAY_DLL_Handle before GSSLEAY_DLL_Handle to avoid exception
Sept 5, 2016  V8.34 Angus, correct next OpenSSL release is 1.1.1 not 1.1.0a
                    Added public variable GSSLEAY_DLL_IgnoreOld so only OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later are loaded
Oct 18, 2016  V8.35 Angus, major rewrite to simplify loading OpenSSL DLL functions
                    Reversed V8.34 fix so this release only supports 1.1.0 not 1.1.1
                    OPENSSL_ALLOW_SSLV2 gone with all SSLv2 functions
                    stub more removed functions to save some exceptions
                    moved all imports from OverbyteIcsLibeayEx to OverbyteIcsLibeay to make
                        maintenance and use easier, OverbyteIcsLibeayEx may be removed
                    EVP_CIPHER_CTX_xx is now backward compatible with 1.1.0
Oct 26, 2016  V8.36 Now using new names for imports renamed in OpenSSL 1.1.0
                    Added ExclusiveAddr property to stop other applications listening on same socket
                    Added extended exception information, set SocketErrs = wsErrFriendly for
                      some more friendly messages (without error numbers)
                    ESocketException has several more properties to detail errors
Nov 04, 2016  V8.37 Fixed memory leak in RaiseException in last build
Nov 15, 2016  V8.38 Don't hide detailed load SSL exceptions
                    Added IcsVerifyTrust to check authenticode code signing digital
                      certificate and hash on EXE and DLL files, note currently
                      ignores certificate revoke checking since so slow
                    Added public variable GSSL_SignTest_Check to check OpenSSL
                      DLLs are digitally signed, and GSSL_SignTest_Certificate to
                      check for a valid certificate, both default to false
Nov 23, 2016  V8.39 Minimum OpenSSL support is now 1.0.2 (1.0.1 support ceases Dec 2016)
                    Added functions to check certificate params using X509_VERIFY_PARAM,
                      which means the peer certificate common name is now checked against
                      the host set as SslServerName during handshaking instead of needing
                      to use PostConnectionCheck in the handshake event.
                    Added more SslVerifyFlags for extra certificate verification options
                    Added SslCheckHostFlags to context to control host name checking
                    Added SslCertPeerName property set after successfull SSL handshake
                      and peer certificate check that returns matched name from certificate
                    Combined TX509Ex properties into TX509Base from OverbyteIcsSslX509Utils
                    TX509Base has new methods CheckHost, CheckEmail and CheckIPaddr as
                      alternatives to PostConnectionCheck using OpenSSL APIs
                    Added SslGetAllCerts to context to get list of certificates from
                      context store, may be used to check CA certificates have been
                      correctly loaded from files, 1.1.0 and later
                    TX509List has new LoadAllFromFile method to load all certificates
                      from a bundle file
                    Added IcsSslOpenFileBio and IcsSslLoadStackFromInfoFile which were
                       previously methods in TSslContext so they can be used elsewhere
                    Added IcsUnwrapNames which changes multi-line string to comma string
                    Added SslCertX509 to context which returns last certificate loaded
                       for reporting purposes (can not be set yet)
Jan 27, 2017  V8.40 TX509Base can now read and save all common X509 certificate file formats:
                       .PEM, .CER, .CRT - Base64 encoded DER - LoadFromPemFile/SaveToPemFile
                       .DER, .CER, .CRT - binary DER - LoadFromPEMFile/SaveToDERFile
                       .P7B, .P7R, .SPC - PKCS#7 - LoadFromP7BFile/SaveToP7BFile
                       .PFX, .P12 - PKCS#12 - LoadFromP12File/SaveToP12File
                       PEM/P12 may have certificate and private key
                       PEM/P7B/P12 may have extra intermediate certificates
                    LoadFromFile/SaveToFile uses file extension to choose file format
                    Extra options for TX509Base methods to load and save files to
                      specify if private key should be read or saved and the password
                    TX509Base will now encrypt private keys with a password
                    CheckCertAndPKey in TX509Base checks cert and pkey match
                    SslCertX509 in context now public not published, returns certificate and
                       private key from the context rather than what was loaded, and may be
                       used to set both, overriding any previous settings
                    Fixed bug in TX509Base.SerialNumHex to show correct serial, note most
                       browsers display serial in hex not a numeric value,
                    Added SerialNumHexto GetCertInfo
                    Fixed bug in TX509Base.SerialNum to clear SSL error for an illegal serial,
                        to avoid handshaking later failing with 'asn1_get_uint64:too large'
                        (mainly when logging was enabled)
                    TX509Base.SerialNum now returns an int64 instead of integer, but only
                        correctly with 1.1.0 and later (or use SerialNumHex instead)
                    Added SslSecLevel to context to set security level (1.1.0 and later),
                       defaults to sslSecLevel80bits, set sslSecLevelNone for SSLv3
                    Added CheckPrivateKey to context which checks loaded certificate and
                       private key match
                    Added OnSslProtoMsg event which receives SSL protocol messages
                        (in binary, need decoding) for debugging purposes
                    Added loSslDevel to ICS logger which replaces many loSslInfo logging
                       lines for BIO. read and write which are really internal ICS development
                       use to make logging more readable, added more useful loSslInfo lines
                    Added SslBuildCertChain to context for servers to validate correct
                       certificates loaded OK  (not sure how useful yet)
                    Added ReadOnly option to IcsSslOpenFileBio since mostly we don't
                       want to update certificates
                    GetKeyInfo now support both RSA and EC keys, displays curve names
                    Added GetPKeyRawText to display private key raw values
                    Added PrivateKeyInfo to display private key type and size
                    Added CertPolicies, AuthorityKeyId, SubjectKeyId and CRLDistribution
                      extended certificate properties
                    Added ExtendedValidation returns true for EV certificates
Feb 26, 2017  V8.41 Fix bug in last build with TX509Base PEM cert error handling
                    Simplified checks for base64 certificates
                    Binary format certificate files are now saved correctly
                    Implemented intermediate certificate support in TX509Base which
                      includes loading and saving them from file formats supporting
                      them, and LoadIntersFromPemFile, LoadIntersFromString,
                      SaveIntersToToPemFile, GetIntersList and ListInters.
                    Implemented CA certificate support in TX509Base mainly for
                      chain verification, LoadCAFromPemFile, LoadCAFromString.
                    KeyInfo displays correct key length and curve for certificates
                    CertInfo has Brief option for shorter description
                    ValidateCertChain in TX509Base checks and reports cert and inters
                       and can save a lot of cert problems in servers
                    Added AllCertInfo to TX509List that reports all certificates and
                       can save code in clients reporting certificates
                    Added sslCiphersMozillaSrvInterFS with only forward security ciphers
                    Added IsCertLoaded, IsPkeyLoaded and IsInterLoaded to TX509Base
                    Added SslKeyAuth property to get cipher key authentication
                    Added SslGetCerts to context to get cert, key and intermediates
                    Added SslSetCertX509 to context which sets cert, key and
                       intermediates from FSslCertX509 to load all together
                    If FSslCertX509 in Context has cert loaded when context is
                      initialised, context file properties are ignored and
                      SslSetCertX509 called to load them.
                    Made InitializeSsl public in TSslBaseComponent for more control
                      over SSL loading and unloading
Mar 3, 2017  V8.42 Angus couple of cross platform fixes, thanks to Bill Florac
                   Fixed a change of behaviour made in V8.22 to only effect SSL,
                     beware this means non-SSL applications that break ICS design
                     rules by calling the message handler in the OnDataAvailable
                     event risking re-entrancy may again fail (which was the
                     case before V8.22).
Mar 7, 2017  V8.43  Added new ComponentOptions wsoAsyncDnsLookup and
                        wsoIcsDnsLookup, thanks to ant_s@rambler.ru.
                    Setting wsoAsyncDnsLookup causes Connect to use async DNS
                      lookups instead of blocking sync without needing to call
                      DnsLookUp first and then Connect.
                    Setting wsoIcsDnsLookup causes DnsLookUp to use a thread for
                       async DNS lookups for IPv4 (previously only IPv6) to avoid
                       a windows limitation of one active DNS lookup per thread.
Mar 14, 2017  V8.44 ReverseDnsLookup supports wsoIcsDnsLookup to use thread
                    SslSetCertX509 did not load Inter unless Cert set
Apr 11, 2017  V8.45 Added multiple SSL host support to TSslWSocketServer.
                    CertInfo shows expiry date for brief (it's important).
                    Added TriggerSslServerName so it can be overriden.
                    Added TSslSrvSecurity SSL server security level, used by
                       TIcsHost, sets protocol, cipher and SslSecLevel.
Apr 20, 2017  V8.46 Added sslCiphersNoDH which blocks DH and DHE ciphers,
                       needed for forums.embarcadero.com
                    Adjusted a V8.42 cross platform fix
May 15, 2017  V8.47 Fixed ValidateCertChain ignoring some warnings
May 22, 2017  V8.48 Added added wsDnsLookup SocketState during wsoAsyncDnsLookup
                    Cancel async DNS if close called before connect
June 26, 2017 V8.49 SSL changes in other units, MacOS fixes in other units
Sep 21, 2017  V8.50 LoadFromP12File correctly supports croYes as well as croTry
                    PrivKeyECX25519 is now correctly PrivKeyEd25519
Nov 23, 2017  V8.51 Testing OpenSSL 1.1.1 that adds TLS/1.3, not enabled yet.
                    Added SHA3 digests to TEvpDigest
                    Added RSS-PSS keys to TSslPrivKeyType
                    Better reporting of ED25519 and RSS-PSS keys, report number
                      of security bits for private keys.
                    Fixed SslContext Options being ignored with 1.1.0 due to macros
                       being changed to exported functions.  This meant some features
                       like server cipher preference never worked with 1.1.0.
                    Added SslIntOptions2 to replace SslIntOptions with 1.1.0 and
                       later removing all obsolete options and adding new, set
                       in SslContext as SslOptions2.
                    Changed the way SSlContext Options are set since it did not
                      work properly until OpenSSL was loaded with 1.1.0 and later
                    Added SslContext SslCryptoGroups for 1.1.1 to set which
                       curve groups are supported in preference order.
                    Improved debug diagnostics and added more for SSL.
Feb 19, 2018 V8.52  LocalIpList only uses GetHostByName for Windows XP, 2003 and
                       earlier which also solves a MacOS issue.
                    Renamed PublicKey property to X509PublicKey to avoid confusion.
                    Added PublicKeySaveToText saves public part of private key.
                    Added PublicKeyLoadFromText loads public key into private key
                    Fixed a problem with BIO_get_flags and 1.1.1 that caused SSL to
                      fail, thanks to Rui for finding this.
                    Added sslCipherTLS13 server cipher suites for TLSv1.3.
                    Cleaned up SSL handshake message for TLSv1.3 .
                    IcsSslOpenFileBio now checks PEM files not empty to avoid
                      strange ASN1 errors parsing them.
                    Fixed IcsSslGetEVPDigest to work with 1.1.1
Apr 06, 2018 V8.53  CertInfo shows OU if available, but less in brief mode
                    ValidateCertChain checks issuer OU for duplicate roots
                    Added sanity check to GetSha1Hex if certificate not loaded
                    Ignore CliNewSession event with TLSv1.3 since session not yet
                      established until after handshake.
                    Ignore second handshake start in InfoCallback with TLSv1.3
                       since renegotiation not supported by protocol.
May 21, 2018 V8.54  Added TSslCliSecurity similar to TSslSrvSecurity
                    Added SslCliSecurity to SslContext which if set to other
                      than sslCliSecIgnore sets the protocols, security and
                      ciphers to standardised settings, may be changed without
                      reinitialising the context.
                    Improved SSL handshake failed error message with protocol
                      state information instead of just saying closed unexpectedly.
                    CertInfo shows Valid From date
Jun 27, 2018 V8.55  Server also ignores second handshake start in InfoCallback with
                        TLSv1.3, so it works again.
                    Prevent multiple SslHandshakeDone events for TLSv1.3 which broke
                       FTP client and possibly other protocols.
                    Use NewSessionCallback for clients as well as servers.
                    TX509Base adds SslPWUtf8 to use UTF8 for private key passwords,
                       defaults to true for OSSL 1.1.0 and later, otherwise ANSI.
                    sslSrvSecInter/FS, sslCliSecInter now requires TLS1.1, PCI
                      council EOF TLS1.0 30 June 2018.
                    Added SslCliSecurityNames for TSslCliSecurity dialogs and
                      SslSrvSecurityNames for TSslSrvSecurity dialogs.
                    OnSslHandshakeDone is now called if StartSslHandshake or
                      AcceptSslHandshake raises an exception to report the SSL
                      error (previously only in the debug log).
                    Added sslCliSecDefault and sslSrvSecDefault recommended
                       security defaults, two more client security levels
                    Ensure that SSL alerts are logged with more detail.
Jul 14, 2018 V8.56  Support SSL application layer protocol negotiation (ALPN)
                     extension which is sent with the initial SSL hello.
                    For clients, SslAlpnProtocols sets SslContext with a list of
                      protocols the application supports (ie http/1.1, h2), and
                      SslAlpnProtocol property after connection returns whatever
                      the server selected (if any).
                    For servers, there is a new OnSslAlpnSelect event that has
                       the list of protocols from the client, from which one
                       may be selected (ie H2 to support HTTP/2).
                    Added IPv6 support for TCustomSocksWSocket and
                       TCustomHttpTunnelWSocket, thanks to Max Terentiev.
Oct 5, 2018  V8.57  Tidy up UnwrapNames.
                    WriteIntersToBio now ignores self signed certificate which
                       are roots not an intermediate.
                    Added TSslCliCertMethod so an SSL server asks a client to
                       send an SSL certificate.
                    Support OpenSSL 1.1.1 final with TLS/1.3.
                    CertInfo returns blank if no certificate loaded.
                    ValidateCertChain ExpireDays warning now configurable,
                      defaults to 30 days, used to order new certificates.
                    Moved some SSL types and lits to OverbyteIcsSSLEAY.
                    Fixed compiler hints in GetProc
Nov 2, 2018  V8.58 Increased ListenBacklog property default to 15 to handle
                      higher server loads before rejecting new connections.
                   Corrected some debug error loSslInfo to loSslErr.
Dec 11, 2018 V8.59 Too many lines in SSL diags for errors only, bug in V8.55
Mar 18, 2019 V8.60 Added AddrResolvedStr read only resolved IPv4 or IPv6 address
                     set during Connect method after DNS lookup.
                   Clean-up old commented out code.
                   Made SocketFamilyNames more descriptive.
                   Moved OnDNSLookupDone before internal Connect attempt so
                      user can change DNS result, bug in V8.43.
                   DnsResult can now be updated in OnDNSLookupDone event.
                   Added TLS version to SslSrvSecurityNames.
                   Added sslSrvSecTls12Less and sslSrvSecTls13Only to disable
                     in server IcsHosts if TLS1.3 fails.
Apr 16, 2019 V8.61 Fixed ValidateCertChain to check certificate start and expiry
                      dates in UTC time instead of local time.
Aug 07, 2019 V8.62 Added SslCtxPtr to SslContext to allow use of OpenSSL functions
                     outside this unit.
                   DHParams only needed for servers, don't use if using client
                     security to avoid issues with high security levels.
                   Raise background exception for user exceptions in OnDataAvailable
                     event rather than silently ignoring them.
                   SSL ALPN now properly tested, for client SslAlpnProtocol property
                     returns what the server selects (if anything), for server the
                     selected protocol is now correctly sent.
                   Moved FIcsLogger to TIcsWndControl ao that unit can log errors.
                   Added source to HandleBackGroundException so we know where
                       errors come from, when using IcsLogger.
Nov 18, 2019 V8.63 Corrected fix for user exceptions in OnDataAvailable in last
                     version to break receive loop after exception handling.
                   Added LoadFromP12Buffer to load PFX certificate from buffer to
                     TX509Base, thanks to Mitzi.
                   GetSelfSigned now has better check for self signed certificates.
                   Added Sha256Digest and Sha256Hex to TX509Base.
                   CertInfo in TX509Base shows SHA256 fingerprint instead of SHA1.
May 18, 2020 V8.64 Added support for International Domain Names for Applications (IDNA),
                     i.e. using accents and unicode characters in domain names.
                   DnsLookup now converts Unicode IDN into A-Label (Punycode ASCII)
                     so accented and non-ansi domains lookup correctly.  PunycodeHost
                     is read only with the converted name for display, i.e.
                     éxàmplê.ftptest.co.uk converts to xn--xmpl-0na6cm.ftptest.co.uk.
                   ReverseDnsLookup converts a A-Label (Punycode ASCII) domain name
                     to Unicode, if the ACE prefix xn-- is found in a name.
                   Added new ComponentOptions: wsoUseSTD3AsciiRules will cause
                     DnsLookup to fails if there are illegal symbols in domain names,
                     wsoIgnoreIDNA uses old behaviour for ANSI domain names so
                     no Unicode support, only limited ASNI, sometimes.
                   X509 certificate A-Label domain names converted to Unicode.
                   OpenSSL uses A-Label (Punycode ASCII) in host names, not UTF8.
                   Open and save SSL certificate files with Unicode names not ANSI.
                   Sample OverbyteIcsBatchDnsLookup has lots of ISN test names.
                   Support new OpenSSL 1.1.1 ClientHelloCallback which mostly
                     replaces ServerName callback setting all client negotiation
                     information before the SSL session starts in the CliHelloData
                     property.  The onSslServerName event is still called, from
                     where you can access CliHelloData and SslServerName.
                   WSocketGetCliHelloStr function returns description of CliHelloData.
                   Allows the server to choose an SSL context appropriate to the
                     client's capabilities, such as for Let'S Encrypt acme-tls/1
                     challenge which did not work before, or ECC SSL certificates
                     which are smaller than RSA but not always supported.
                   The onSslAlpnSelect event is now only needed to tell the client
                     which ALPN to choose, generally for HTTP/2 only.
                   Ignore any errors with SSL APLN during handshake.
                   Fixed a problem with SSL ALPN server handshake that may have
                     caused unexpected exceptions mainly on 64-bit applications.
                   Removed TlsExtension_cb callback which wrote a lot to the
                     debug log, same information now in CliHelloData property
                     from ClientHelloCallback.
                   Another attempt to improve handshake error messages.
                   Removed X509CATrust and related properties and methods from
                      TX509Base, it was used by the ValidateCertChain method which
                      now accepts a shared TX509List instead for efficiency.
                   Fixed memory leak in SslGetAllCerts, and bad declarations of
                      SslProtoMsgCallback and CheckIPaddr thanks to Ralf Junker.
Dec 17, 2020 V8.65 No exception trying to change winsock version with SetReqVerLow.
                   GetPKeyRawText has flag to show public key only.
                   FPiette fixed he code so that the exception related to wrong
                       OpenSSL flows correctly up to the application instead of
                       triggering successive access violation exceptions.
                   CertInfo has ISO date/time instead of local date formst.
                   Write comments as UTF8 to certificate PEM file.
                   When reading and loading SSL/TLS certificates and private keys,
                     ICS now parses the PEM bundle one at a time and optionally
                     lists errors about bad certificatss instead of just failing
                     with a stack error. ICS no longer passes extra comments in
                     the bundles to OpenSSL to avoid problems with 8-bit and UTF8
                     characters.
                   Internally simplified reading PEM and similar files by reading
                     them into an ANSI string rather than a File BIO, so common
                     code is used for reading certificates from files or strings
                     for TX509, TX509List and TSslContext.
                   TX509List has new LoadAllFromFileEx and LoadAllFromStringEx
                     which return a list of certificate errors rathern than an
                     exception on the first error.
                   TX509 has new LoadFromPemFileEx, LoadFromFileEx, LoadFromTextEx
                      which return a list of certificate errors rathern than an
                      exception on the first error.  LoadFromFile now returns an
                      exception for unknown file extensions instead of ignoring them.
                   No longer using Ics.InterlockedApi.inc (for a long time).
                   MacOS64 does not support inline assembler so set PUREPASCAL.
                   Changed Longint to Integer and LongWord to Cardinal to keep
                     MacOS64 happy since it thinks both are 64-bits.
                   Added note:  About TCP Window Size, Buffer Size and Performance Tuning.
                   Ignore exception in Destroy freeing winsock.
                   Added ICS_LOCAL_HOST_NAME
                   TriggerSendData now virtual.
                   Prevent overflow in GetMaskBits.
                   Fixed several memory leaks in OpenSSL API calls, thanks to Ralf Junker.
                   Fixed a possible pointer out of scope issue in IcsSslOpenFileBio
                     opening SSL certificate files, seems to effect some Delphi versions
                     more than others, thanks to Linden Roth and Alexander Pastuhov.
                   Fixed more pointer out of scope issues with certificate passwords.
                   Renamed Ics.Posix.Messages.pas to Ics.Posix.PXMessages.pas
                     to avoid conflicts with projects loading it instead of
                     WinApi.Messages.
                   Fixed PrivateKeyLoadFromText got broken recently.
Mar 26, 2021 V8.66 Corrected integer overflow in WSocketIsDottedIP with full numeric
                      IP address which is not supported.
                   Renamed all OpenSSL functions to original names removing ICS
                     f_ prefix.
                   Removed support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 whose support ceased
                     Dec 2019, also Fips mode pending 3.0.
                   SslContext SslOptions now ignored, use SslOptions2 instead which
                      has more modern options.  Can not remove SslOptions because it's
                      saved on too many DFMs.
                   Added support for YuOpenSSL which provides OpenSSL in a pre-built
                     DCU linked into applications, rather than using external DLLs.
                   Ssl Renegotiation disabled, no longer recommended.
                   New TSslWSocket method SslOK is TLS/SSL negotiated OK.
                   LoadVerifyLocations no longer lets OpenSSL use default CA folder
                      locations which is potentially a security risk, also fixes
                      a problem with YuOpenSSL, thanks to Ralf Junker for the fix.
                   Made SslVerifyResult public.
                   After SSL handshake, ignore OpenSSL errors if certificate chain
                     verified OK.
                   Socks proxy and tunneling again support host names, broken in V8.56,
                     thanks to Fr0sT.Brutal.  Also made HttpTunnelState property readable,
                   In 2021 Mozilla now recommends TLSv1.3 as modern ciphers and TLSv1.2/1.3
                     as Intermediate supporting all browsers from last five years, so IcsHosts
                     now uses sslCiphersMozillaSrvTLS12 as Intermediate level, also Mozilla
                     recommends no cipher server preference so changed that.
                   Added ProxyURL property to set SOCKS or HTTP Tunnel proxy settings using
                     single URL, ie proto://[user:password@]host:port where proto = socks5 or
                     http. Also new methods SetSocks and SetHTTPTunnel to set proxy properties
                     in a single call, thanks to Fr0sT.Brutal.
Sep 27, 2021 V8.67 SendTo and SendTo6 now set LastError on failure (Send, SendStr, etc
                      already did so).
                   TX509Base.ValidateCertChain reports CA roots for multiple certificate
                     verification paths with two or more intermediate certificates, rather
                     than only the last.
                   Added PKCS12 certificate encryption of AES256 CBC, since previous
                     default 3DES is not supported by OpenSSL 3.0 unless the legacy module
                     is loaded. Beware AES256 not recognised until Windows Server 2016 v1709
                     and Windows 10 v1709, so Server 2012, Windows 10 RTM and earlier won't
                     load AES keys.  Tweaked default parameters for backward compatibility.
                   OpenSSL 3.0 unload any providers we loaded.
                   Added TX509Base.SaveToP12Buf.
                   Added TX509Base.CertMainInfo provides a single line with the main
                     certificate information.
                   Added TX509Base.Comments/CertName/KeyName for certificate information when
                     exporting Windows store certificates, or building bundles.
                   Fail to open passworded private key, retry without password.
                   Added TX509Base.ComparePkey to compare supplied private key with ours.
Jan 04, 2022 V8.68 Support OpenSSL 3.0 for YuOpenSSL.
                   Updated Load/SaveP7BFile for OpenSSL 3.0.
                   Improved OpenSSL error handling to say 'No error returned' instead of
                      error:00000000:lib(0):func(0):reason(0).
                   ValidateCertChain no longer reports an error for the expired 'DST Root CA
                      X3' CA root, since some platforms accept expired roots.
                   Clear LastError in Listen and Connect methods to avoid false errors later.
                   Improved source description for some fatal background errors.
                   AbortComponent has Exception argument so higher level components can report
                     errors better, such as out of memory without needing BgException handler.
May 26, 2022 V8.69 Restored TlsExtension_cb callback for client debugging, ClientHelloCallback
                     only works with servers.
                   Added TX509Base.UrlOcsp and TX509Base.UrlIssuer properties to parse the
                     certificate authority extension and get useful URLs.
                   Added TX509List.FindSubject and TX509List.IndexOfSubj to find certificate
                     by SubjectOneLine, to find issuer certificate in bundle.
                   Added TX509List.SaveToStack which saves all the list certificates to a
                     Stack to pass to OpenSSL functions.
                   Added TX509List.SetX509Store which sets the property X509Store with all
                     the list certificates for use with OpenSSL chain verification functions.
                   Added OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) support to TX509List to
                     create requests and process responses, used to check certificates are
                     legitimately issued and not revoked (instead of Certificate Revocation
                     Lists).  OCSP uses HTTP POST requests, but these are handled using the
                     TOcspHttp component in the OverbyteIcsSslHttpRest unit.
                     BuildOCSPCertId builds a CertId for the certificate and intermediate in
                     the list, BuildOCSPReq builds an OCSP request for the CertId, CheckOCSPResp
                     checks the OCSP response against a CertId and verifies it against the
                     intermediate issuer and X509Store setting various properties, OcspRespStatus,
                     OcspRespStatusStr, OcspCertStatus, OcspCertStatusStr, OcspCertReason,
                     OcspCertReasonStr, OcspRevokeDT, OcspUpdateDT and OcspNextUpdDT, with the
                     full diagnostic request and response being returned as strings by OCSPReqInfo
                     and OCSPRespInfo.  Applications should use TOcspHttp.CheckOcspRevoked instead
                     of these TX509List functions.
                   Added OCSP Stapling TSslContext.SslOcspStatus=True, which for clients causes
                     the remote server to send an OCSP response as part of the initial handshake
                     to avoid contacting an OCSP HTTP server directly.  For servers, we get the
                     OCSP response using HTTP and send it as part of the handshake, in
                     TSslWSocketServer.  TSslContext.GetX509Store returns an X509STORE with all
                     the context certificates for use with OpenSSL chain verification functions.
                     TSslWSocket.OcspStapleRaw returns the OCSP response from the client
                     handshake which can be passed to TOcspHttp.CheckOcspRevoked for checking,
                     or for servers can be set with the response to be sent back to clients.
                     For clients, OcspStapleStatus is set to response status (before
                     certificate checking).
                   Default SSL context option SslOpt2_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT needed for servers
                     that don't support secure renegotiation (but which are a security risk).
                   Default sslOpt2_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION for clients to connect to
                     such servers.
                   Added SendTB(const Data: TBytes; Len: Integer = -1) where Len is optional,
                     also similar SendToTB and SendToTB6 with TBytes.
                   Moved some common OpenSSL functions like LoadSsl to OverbyteIcsLIBEAY as
                     IcsLoadSsl so they can be used in projects without WSocket.
Oct 08, 2022 V8.70 Handle background exception in ResetSSL, and more logging.
                   Added new ComponentOptions wsoNoSendException which stops an exception
                     being raised if Send is called when the socket is not connected, which
                     can happen if the connection drops unexpectedly.
                   Use HasOption instead of in for all ComponentOptions checks.
                   Improved Unicode compatibility by adding UnicodeString overloads of various
                     AnsiString functions: WSocketGetHostByAddr, WSocketGetHostByName,
                     WSocketResolveIp, WSocketResolveHost, WSocketResolvePort, WSocketResolveProto,
                     WSocketIsDottedIP, WSocket_WSAAsyncGetHostByName, WSocket_WSAAsyncGetHostByAddr,
                     WSocket_getservbyname, WSocket_getprotobyname, WSocket_gethostbyname,
                     WSocket_setsockopt, WSocket_getsockopt, WSocket_inet_add,
                     WSocket_Synchronized_ResolveHost, WSocket_Synchronized_inet_addr,
                     WSocket_Synchronized_ResolvePort, WSocket_Synchronized_ResolveProto.
                     Added GetLocalHostName: String; and WSocket_inet_ntoaW.
                   Added ReceiveTB(var Data : TBytes; MaxLen : Integer = -1) : Integer; where MaxLen
                     is optional, to receive TCP data into a TBytes dynamic array of bytes. Also
                     ReceiveFromTB and ReceiveFrom6TB for UDP datagrams.
Jul 10, 2023 V8.71 Protect inherited class destroys from exceptions at higher levels, thanks to
                     Jaroslav Kulísek for these changes.
                   Stop Winsock being unloaded if socket creation fails, using FWSocketGCountIncremented,
                     thanks to Jaroslav Kulísek.
                   Protect close socket errors in destroy.
                   Fix range check error in ReceiveFromTB.
                   Using Int64 ticks.
                   TWSocketCounter and TCustomTimeoutWSocket now use Int64 counters, if updated with
                     GetTickCount in other units should be changed to IcsGetTickCount64.
                   Added WSocketSockAddrToStr to convert TSockAddrIn6 with IPv4 or PIv6 address to
                     string, used elsewhere to simplify code.
                   Added WSocketIPAddrToSocAddr to convert IPv4 or IPv6 address into TSockAddrIn6,
                     result family AF_UNSPEC for failure.
                   Added function WSocketIPv4ToSocIn6 (TSockAddrIn6) to remove horrible casting in
                     various units.
                   Added function WSocketFamilyToAF to find family for Windows APIs from TSocketFamily.
                   ReceiveTB no longer fails if buffer not initialised.
                   Added overloaded ReceiveTB that returns a TByte instead of the received size.
                   Added function WSocketIPv6Same to compare two TIcsIPv6Address.
                   Added functions IcsReverseIP and IcsReverseIPv6 from DnsQuery.
                   Fixed range check error in WSocket_Synchronized_ResolveHost with IPv4 address
                     with last byte higher than 127.
                   Implemented Assign in TSslBaseComponent and TX509Base, thanks to uso.
                   SetX509Inters in TX509Base now correctly duplicates certificates instead
                     of just pointers which could cause crashes on free.
Aug 08, 2023 V9.0  Updated version to major release 9.
Mar 07, 2024 V9.1  Moved TSslContext, TSslBaseComponent, TX509Base and TX509List to OverbyteIcsSslBase
                     to simplify this unit, left SslContext callbacks here since they need access to
                     it, now set in InitSSLConnection instead of InitContext.
                   No longer supporting defines OPENSSL_USE_DELPHI_MM (never used),
                     OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE (deprecated, never used), OPENSSL_USE_RESOURCE_STRINGS
                     (never used), NO_OSSL_VERSION_CHECK (dangerous), DEFINE OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT
                     (TLS needed everywhere), LOADSSL_ERROR_FILE (better debugging now).
                   If a connection fails, don't change State to wsConnected briefly before
                      changing it again to wsClosed.
                   Added TSslWsocket SslAlpnProtocols property to specify a list of protocols
                     for clients to send to servers, instead of a similar SslContext property.
                   Published AddrFormat, resolved family AF_INET or AF_INET6 after connection.
                   Fixed AddrFormat not set properly if AddrResolved by DnsLookup.
Jun 06, 2024 V9.2  Added Ics.Posix.EpollTypes and Ics.Posix.EpollApi, various changes to
                     TIcsEventQueue adding Linux and Android support in addition to MacOS
                     and IOS, not tested or supported yet.
Sep 20, 2024 V9.3  Moved many types and constants to OverbyteIcsTypes for consolidation.
                   Moved various IPv4/6 conversion functions to OverbyteIcsUtils so they can
                     be used without sockets.
                   Made TIcsEventQueue public for testing.
                   Note, MacOS support is disabled pending new implementation.
                   Moved IsIPv6APIAvailable and IsIPv6Available here from Winsock.
                   Report EC Group Name during handshake, OpenSSL 3.2 and later.
                   Added TSslCertVerifyEvent for TCertVerMethod = CertVerOwnEvent.
Feb 03, 2025 V9.4  Fixed a potential problem using multiple threads where a new connection
                     opened very quickly (ie localhost) and then stalled due to an
                     unexpected connection state, thanks to Roger Tinembart for the fix.
                   When opening a new connection, set state to wsConnected before calling
                     connect in case the new connection opens very quickly (ie localhost)
                     and then stalls due to an unexpected connection state in the event
                     handler triggered.
                   Changed u_long to LongWord from Longint since this is what Windows
                     uses, and IPv4 addresses are never negative, should prevent some
                     integer overflow errors.
                     This effects TInAddr, in_add, TSockAddrIn, sockaddr_in
                   Changed TIcsIPv4Address and in_addr6.u6_addr32 to LongWord from Integer.
                   Updated Base64 encoding functions to IcsBase64 functions.
                   Fixed a nasty SSL close down issue in Do_FD_CLOSE that could cause an
                     endless loop if SSL data was received after close down was completed
                     but before the handles were reset, only seen with a recent Nginx web
                     server. Improved some debug logging.
                   Made DataToString unicode compatible, only used for diagnostic dump logs.
Sep 10, 2025 V9.5  Added property SessionIpInfo a TIcsSessIpInfo record set after connection
                     with the local and remote IP addresses and ports from the socket, also
                     socket type and protocol, as internal and string versions.  Easier to
                     use than various GetPeer methods. Set for accepted listen connections.
                   Fixed a missing inherited DupConnected that meant counters did not get reset.
                   Removed duplicate CliHelloStr functions previously moved to SslBase.
                   SSL/TLS server name extension does not allow raw IP addresses, convert then
                     to domain names, ie 217.146.102.139 becomes 139.102.146.217.in-addr.arpa
                   Moved IcsInitializeAddr and IcsSizeOfAddr to Utils for use elsewhere.



Use of certificates for SSL clients:
Client SSL applications will usually work without any certificates because all
the encryption is done by the server.  If a client needs to confirm the identity
of a server, set SslVerifyPeer=true and specify a certificate authority root
bundle as SslCAFile, SslCAPath or SslCALines, that contains the certificates
used to sign the server certificate or intermediate certificate, to confirm
they are trusted.  To permanently trust an unknown certificate, save it to
the CA file or path, or add it temporarily using TrustCert.

More rarely in high security operations, the server will need
a client to identify itself with a private certificate before granting access,
and this is where a client SSL certificate and private key are needed.  Client
certificate checking is controlled by the server.  An SslPassPhrase is only
needed if the private key is password protected.

Use of certificates for SSL servers:
Server SSL applications always require an SSL certificate and matching private
key because these control the SSL encryption.  The certificate may also confirm
the identity of the web site using the domain name and often the company name.
To be trusted by browsers and other applications, the SSL certificate needs to
be signed by a root certificate available for local checking.  SSL certificates
are often signed by intermediate certificates rather than root certificates, and
these also need to sent by the server as part of a chain, the intermediate will
have been signed by a trusted root certificate.  To configure an SSL server,
SslCertFile or SslCertLines specify the SSL certificate and optionally
intermediate certificates in same file as a bundle; SslPrivKeyFile or
SslPrivKeyLines specify the private key used to generate the certificate, which
may be optionally password protected by SslPassPhrase; and SslCAFile, SslCAPath
or SslCALines specifies the intermediate certificates if not in the certificate
bundle file.  Also, SslDHParamFile or SslDHParamLines should specify DHParams
which are a secondary encryption key used for some ciphers, ICS has default
DHParams but ideally applications should use unique DHParams.

Sometimes SSL certificates are withdrawn due to misuse such as being stolen
and appear in Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) that are published by SSL
certificate issuers.  Such lists in PEM format may be loaded by
LoadCrlFromFile or LoadCrlFromPath.

Rarely, a server may want to check the identify of clients by requesting a
client SSL certificate by setting SslVerifyPeerModes=SslVerifyMode_PEER.
AddClientCAFromFile and SetClientCAListFromFile are used to set acceptable
CAs For the client certificate.

OpenSSL 1.1.0 and later support security levels, as follows:
    TSslSecLevel = (
         sslSecLevelAny,        // 0 - anything allowed, old compatibility
         sslSecLevel80bits,     // 1 - default, RSA/DH keys=>1024, ECC=>160, no MD5
         sslSecLevel112bits,    // 2 - RSA/DH keys=>2048, ECC=>224, no RC4, no SSL3, no SHA1 certs
         sslSecLevel128bits,    // 3 - RSA/DH keys=>3072, ECC=>256, FS forced, no TLS/1.0
         sslSecLevel192bits,    // 4 - RSA/DH keys=>7680, ECC=>384, no SHA1 suites, no TLS/1.1
         sslSecLevel256bits);   // 5 - RSA/DH keys=>15360, ECC=>512


About multithreading and event-driven:
    TWSocket is a pure asynchronous component. It is non-blocking and
    event-driven. It means that when you request an operation such as connect,
    the component start the operation your requested and give control back
    immediately while performing the operation in the background automatically.
    When the operation is done, an event is triggered (such as
    OnSessionConnected if you called Connect).

    This asynchronous non-blocking behaviour is very high performance but a
    little bit difficult to start with. For example, you can't call Connect and
    immediately call SendStr the line below. If you try, you'll have an
    exception triggered saying you are not connected. Calling connect will start
    connection process but will return long before connection is established.
    Calling SendStr at the next line will not work because the socket is not
    connected yet. To make it works the right way, you have to put your SendStr
    in the OnSessionConnected event.

    The asynchronous operation allows you to do several TCP/IP I/O
    simultaneously. Just use as many component as you need. Each one will
    operate independently of the other without blocking each other ! So you
    basically don't need multi-threading with TWSocket, unless YOUR processing
    is lengthy and blocking.

    If you have to use multithreading, you have two possibilities:
    1) Create your TWSocket from your thread's Execute method
    2) Attach a TWSocket to a given thread using ThreadAttach.
    In both cases, you must set MultiThreaded property to TRUE.
    If you don't use one of those methods, you'll end up with a false
    multithreaded program: all events will be processed by the main tread !
    For both methods to work, you MUST have a message loop withing your thread.
    Delphi create a message loop automatically for the main thread (it's in
    the Forms unit), but does NOT create one in a thread ! For your convenience,
    TWSocket has his own MessageLoop procedure. You can use it from your thread.

    Sample program MtSrv uses first method while ThrdSrv uses second method.
    Sample program TcpSrv is much the same as ThrdSrv but doesn't use any
    thread. You'll see that it is able to server a lot of simultaneous clients
    as well and it is much simpler.

 About TCP Window Size, Buffer Size and Performance Tuning
    The TCP protocol has a window size field to control flow of data, the amount
    of data that can be sent without an acknowledgement that it has been received
    safely and does not need to be repeated.  Back in dial-up days, the window
    size was small since corruption and resending was common.

    Early applications would increase the window size up to the original TCP
    maximum of 64K to improve performance with registry changes or using a TCP
    option that ICS exposes as SocketRcvBufSize and SocketSndBufSize properties
    in TWSocket. In ICS, only the FTP client and server components ever used this
    feature since they did large file transfers. Unfortunately the default buffer
    size never kept up with faster internet speeds which has been fixed with V8.65.

    Windows sets the default TCP window size according to network adaptor speed,
    8K for less than 1Mb, 17K for 1Mb to 100Mb, 64K for 100Mb to 10Gb, 128k
    for 10Gb and faster.

    The total achievable throughput for a connection is window size in bytes
    divided by connection latency or Round Trip Time (RTT) in seconds, with a
    result in bytes per second. So a 64KB window size with 10ms latency allows
    51Mb/sec speed (6.3MB/sec), 20ms is 25Mb, 50ms is 10Mb.

    So the default 64K window size limits performance on low latency networks.
    With Windows Vista/2008 and later, TCP Auto Tuning was added (and the registry
    ignored) using the TCP window scale option (RFC 7323) that allows increased
    window size beyond 64K, up to 16M for Windows.   Auto tuning automatically
    increases the window size dynamically to achieve the best performance,
    rather than being fixed by a predefined window size.

    Windows provides control over auto tuning, type 'netsh interface tcp show
    global' should say AutoTuningLevel normal, but it can be disabled or
    restricted for poor connections.

    Note some older firewalls and routers did not support TCP scaling and
    removed it causing unstable connections and unexplained problems.

    So for best performance, do not change the SocketRcvBufSize and SocketSndBufSize
    properties, let Windows do auto tuning.  With V8.65 for FTP it is no longer
    possible to reduce to the buffer size below that of the Windows default which
    means existing applications setting it below 64K will speed up without change.
    If your application sets buffer sizes for HTTP or other  protocols (which
    ICS never did), we suggest you remove it.
