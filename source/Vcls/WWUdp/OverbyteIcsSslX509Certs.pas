Overview
--------

SSL/TLS X509 certificates
-------------------------

There are effectively three classes of SSL/TLS X509 certificates, Domain Validated,
Organisation Validated and Extended Validated, in order of cost and benefit,
usually with three variations, single domain, multiple domains (SANs), and
wildcard.  Adding multiple domains to a certificate can ease administration and
is cheaper than multiple certificates, wild card means any sub domains usually for
the cost of about six single domains.

Domain Validated certificate issuance is mostly automated so they are cheap (or
free), using one of four challenge methods: file validation where the supplier
checks for a specific file under the domain, usually http://domain/.well-known/file,
domain validation where a special DNS record is created that can be accessed by
the supplier, TLS-ALPN SSL SNI (server name indication) validated where an
https://domain/ connection is opened passing data using the ALPN extension, with
the server returning a special self signed SSL certificate. and email validation
where an email is sent to a predefined address at the domain, ie admin@domain,
with a supplier link that must be clicked to confirm receipt and domain ownership.

File, TLS-ALPN and domain validation challenges can be automated, file is easiest
using a simple HTTP server, TLS-ALPN using an HTTPS server, while domain validation
is dependent on being able to access and control the DNS server of which there are
many different products.  Note validating challenges are not instant, the supplier
may have a queue of challenges waiting to the tested, but usually happen within a
couple of minutes. Applications need to be aware the wait may be longer.
Automated wild card certificates typically use the domain validation challenge.

Organisation and Extended Validated certificates can be ordered online, but
require manual validation that the company or organisation legally exists and is
entitled to use the domain name which may take several days or weeks for extended
validation if legal evidence is required.  Once approved, the certificate and be
downloaded automatically.

Not spent much time testing the commercial ACME suppliers, will only do so if
there is commercial need.  It's possible the component will need tweaking slightly
since each supplier interprets the ACME RFC in slightly different ways.



TSslX509Certs Overview
----------------------

The TSslX509Certs component automatically downloads SSL/TLS X509 certificates from
various ACME suppliers, including free certificates from Let's Encrypt and Google
Trust Services, and commercial certificates from other ACME suppliers such as
Digicert, ZeroSSL, SSL.com, The component automates the process from creating
a new private key and certificate request, placing the order, arranging for
domain validated certificates to be checked by various challenge methods,
collecting the certificate and intermediate, creating PEM and PKC12 bundle files
with the private key, then copying the files to the web server ready for
automatic installation. The TSslWSocketServer, TSslHttpServer, TSslHttpAppSrv,
TIcsProxy, TIcsHttpProxy, TSslFtpServer and TIcsIpStrmLog components can assign
a TSslX509Certs component to support automatic certificate ordering of domain
validated certificates with very little extra code.

The component supports the Acme V2 protocol specified in RFC8555 as originally
implemented by Let's Encrypt to download free domain validated certificates.
You don't need to register with Let's Encrypt, but it only supplies domain
validated certificates so the domains for which you order certificates must
already be registered and have DNS pointing to a live server to satisfy most
challenges.

Earlier versions of this component also supported a custom REST API at CertCentre
AG in Germany for DigiCert commercial certificates, but this service is now
discontinued and support removed from the component. Digicert themselves now
use ACME for commercial certificates, but this has not yet been tested with ICS.

The TSslX509Certs component includes a database of certificate orders and pending
challenges, allowing certificates to be re-ordered and the supplier periodically
checked to see if a challenge has been successful when the X509 certificate can
be automatically downloaded and installed.  Events are generated upon completion
or failure, allowing the application to inform the user (by email) of certificate
ordering progress.

ICS includes a sample OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst that is effectively an X509
certificate management and ordering tool that can be used standalone to order
certificates from Let's Encrypt and Google Trust Services for testing or
commercial use, including wild card certificates provided you run your own
Windows DNS Server.  These certificates can be used automatically by most
non-ICS servers such as Windows IIS or Apache.



TSslX509Certs Acme Supplier Accounts
------------------------------------
From V9.5, ICS has a central Acme Supplier Account database that contains a list
of the Acme work directories previously only referenced in separate IcsHosts INI
files. The database is at C:\ProgramData\ICS-Acme-Accounts\ics-acme-accounts.db,
and each Supplier Account has a Supplier Account Title, Acme Supplier Name, and
Account Directory, which defaults to: C:\ProgramData\ICS-Acme-Accounts\SupplierTitle\
but can be located elsewhere if required.

If an ICS server with automatic certificate ordering starts and no Acme Supplier
Accounts are configured, the server will attempt to create one.  If the INI file
was used prior to V9.5 and CertDirWork is specified with old account details,
a new supplier AcmeLetsEncrypt-Old is created for that existing directory, and
everything should work as previously.  If the INI file has SupplierTitle, no
CertDirWork and sufficient details in IcsHosts, a new supplier is created with
that title, the ICS samples use 'LetsEncrypt-New'.  Note this only happens if
no suppliers are configured, so a typo in INI file does not create an unwanted
supplier.

Otherwise, Acme Supplier Accounts must be created manually using the sample
OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst or functions from the TSslX509Certs component in your
application.  Note Google and other supplier accounts must be created manually,
since they need extra external accounting details that are not in IcsHosts.

Each Supplier Account has an Account Directory in which the account private
key file AcmePrivateKey.pem is created and stored, and all certificate and
related files will be saved, with a database file ics-control.db containing
information about the account, certificate orders and pending challenges.
The account private key (separate to certificate private keys) is used to
identify the account to the supplier and is created automatically if the
directory is blank. This account private key will be needed to cancel or
revoke any certificates issued using it.  Note an account directory and
database can only be accessed by one application at a time, they can
generally not be shared between different servers.

The sample OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst has tabs 'Acme Suppliers' and  'Supplier
Details' that allows accounts to be created and edited, see later for details.


TSslX509Certs Work and Certificate Files
----------------------------------------

When ordering a new certificate, temporary files may be created in the account
directory, the new certificate private key and certificate request.  Once the
order is accepted and an order number is available, these files are renamed to
include the order number for historic purposes, and when the order is completed
a second copy of all files is saved without the order number for final distribution
to the web server, and optionally copied to the web server using a UNC file share.
Note the files without order numbers are always automatically overwritten by new
orders.  So an Let's Encrypt order for the domain test3.telecom-tariffs.co.uk
will generally find the following files upon completion:

ics-control.db
AcmePrivateKey.pem
AcmePublicKey.pem
LE-SA-v1.2-November-15-2017.pdf
LE-5860824-test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-bundle.pem
LE-5860824-test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-certonly.pem
LE-5860824-test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-inters.pem
LE-5860824-test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-privatekey.pem
LE-5860824-test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-request.pem
LE-5860824-test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk.pfx
test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-bundle.pem
test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-certonly.pem
test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-inters.pem
test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-privatekey.pem
test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-request.pem
test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk.pfx

There is a PEM certificate signing request (CSR) file, separate PEM files for the
private key, domain certificate and intermediate certificates, then a combined PEM
bundle  with the certificates and private key, and a PKCS12 PFX file which is a
similar bundle that Windows certificate store accepts.  The certificate private
key files (and bundles) may be optionally password protected, the PFX file always
has a password since Windows requires that, it will be 'password' if not otherwise
specified. Note AcmePrivateKey is unprotected.  A wildcard order for
*.telecom-tariffs.co.uk will have a file name x_telecom-tariffs_co_uk since * can
not be used in file names.  Until the order number is available, the file name
will be LE-work, or CC-work for CertCentre.   There are component options to
ignore some of these files, if not needed.


TSslX509Certs Supplier Order Database
-------------------------------------

For each account there is a database file ics-control.db containing information
about the account. certificate orders and pending challenges.  This is a simple
INI file, and is generally updated only by the TSslX509Certs component.

There is an [account] section or record with general information about the
supplier, logging, next order sequence number, ACME account private key, etc.

There are then multiple [domain-mydomain] sections or records for each X509 order
placed where my-domain is the Common Name of the certificate, and then one
section or record for each Subject Alternate Name on the certificate
[san-mydomain=mysan] including the Common Name which are used for domain
validation. These records are updated as the order progresses and may be
checked afterwards to see the main files created and certificate details.  The
record may be used to re-order a certificate, but not on the same day a
certificate was downloaded to prevent wild repeated orders.

When an order has been placed, a temporary section [challenge-mysan] is created
for each SAN on the certificate to keep track of challenge progress, effectively
a queue of waiting challenges.  This queue is checked every 30 seconds and
the supplier contacted to see if the challenge has completed or failed, the
section is then removed with the main domain and san records updated.

The sample OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst has tabs 'Supplier Orders',  'Cert Domain',
'Cert Admin' and 'Supplier New Order' that show all existing orders and allow
new orders to be started.


TSslX509Certs Challenges
------------------------

To authenticate Domain Validated X509 certificates, the TSslX509Certs component
offers various challenge methods, variously used by different suppliers, products
and ICS components.  Challenges work by the supplier generating a short random
phrase which must become accessible on the public internet using the domains for
which a certificate is being ordered to prove that domain is controlled by whoever
placed the order.

ChallFileUNC  - File - Web Server - UNC: copies a small file into the .well-known
                directory of the server using a UNC path, may be any type of web
                server on the same or remote PC.  Once the challenge is done,
                the issued X509 certificate may be copied to that server.
                Requires a web server listening on port 80 and the domain being
                validated and path /.well-known/.  If a certificate is being
                ordered with two or more Alternate Subject Names, separate
                challenges are required for each separate domain name.  Wild card
                certificates are not supported.

ChallFileFtp  - File - Web Server - FTP: similar to ChallFileUNC, but the
                application needs extra code to copy the file using FTP.

ChallFileApp  - File - App Web Server: similar to ChallFileUNC, but handles the
                challenge file virtually without creating any files using a
                little code in the web server onWellKnownDir event to call an
                function in TSslX509Certs where the path is checked and a virtual
                file returned with the challenge data.  Currently supported by
                the SslHttpServer, TSslHttpAppSrv, TIcsProxy and TIcsHttpProxy
                components, see SslHttpAppSrv1WellKnownDir in the sample
                OverbyteIcsSslMultiWebServ1.pas for an example.

ChallFileSrv  - File - Local Web Server: similar to ChallFileApp, but uses a
                local web server TSimpleWebSrv listening on port 80 and the
                domain being validated, provided no other web server is using
                the same port and IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  This is used by the
                sample OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst to order certificates separately
                without needing a web server, and by the TSslFtpServer and other
                components which don't usually listen on port 80.  The local web
                server is only run while waiting for the challenge to be accessed
                by the supplier, usually about a minute, but can not conflict
                with any other web server on the same IP address.

ChallDnsAuto  - DNS - Automatic: the challenge comprises a TXT record in the
                Domain Name Server Forward Lookup Zone for the domain.  Currently,
                this requires application code to access the DNS server which is
                in the sample OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst.  It uses WMI to access a
                Windows 2012 or later public DNS Server on the same PC.  Future
                releases could support Cloudflare DNS via a REST API, and maybe
                other cloud providers.  The benefit of using DNS is no conflicts
                with web servers, and ordering wild card certificates like
                *.ftptest.org that work with any sub-domains to avoid ordering
                certificates for each.  A certificate may have multiple wild card
                names, such as *.ftptest.org.uk and *.ftptest.co.uk.

ChallDnsAcnt  - DNS Account- Automatic: similar to ChallDnsAuto, but adds an
                account hash before _acme-challenge.domain. This challenge is
                Acme account specific, so different accounts can get certificates
                for the same domain name allowing redundancy.  Not tested yet
                since not supported by any suppliers.

ChallDnsMan   - DNS - Manual: similar to ChallDnsAuto, but just calls an event
                in the application which finds an alternate method of updating
                the Domain Name Server, supported in OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst
                which allows DNS to be updated manually before starting the
                actual certificate order.

ChallAlpnApp  - TLS-ALPN - App Web: this challenge uses the normal SSL port 443
                to avoid needing a non-SSL web server running on port 80. A
                special SSL/TLS certificate is created for the domain containing
                the challenge phrase which is returned instead of the normal
                certificate when the SSL client hello includes a special ALPN.
                This needs one line in the onClientConnect event to call a
                function in TSslX509Certs where the certificate is created.
                See the sample OverbyteIcsSslMultiWebServ1.pas for an example.
                Only catch with this challenge is requesting the first certificate
                for a new domain, the server won't start without a certificate,
                so the TWSocketServer component automatically creates an ICS
                signed certificate so the service can start, which is ideally
                replaced a few seconds later when the order completes.

ChallAlpnSrv  - TLS-ALPN - Local Web: similar to ChallAlpnApp, but uses a local
                web server TSimpleWebSrv listening on port 443 and the domain
                being validated, provided no other web server is using the same
                port and address, see comments about ChallFileSrv above.

ChallAlpnUNC  - TLS-ALPN - Web UNC: similar to ChallAlpnApp, but copies the
                special SSL certificate to another server that is responsible
                for implementing the ALPN part of the process, don't know of
                such a web server.

ChallEmail    - Email Manually:  calls an event in the application, that could
                send an email automatically, was supported for CertCentre.

For all the automated challenges above, the certificate order process involves
first testing the challenge with locally generated data to ensure the servers
are responding correctly from the public internet, then getting the real
challenge data from the supplier and again checking it can be accessed from the
public internet, before asking the supplier to start testing the challenges.
Let's Encrypt and Google now test challenges several times from servers in
different countries networks to avoid DNS spoofing.  In practice this all
takes place within seconds.

Beware that within a few seconds of a certificate order being completed, hackers
will start making intrusion attempts on the server domain name, typically looking
for PHP pages used to administer popular web servers, which ICS applications
will ignore.  This happens because all SSL certificate appear in public
transparency logs, and the hackers watch these logs.


TSslX509Certs IssueState
-------------------------

The component keeps the IssueState for each order and pending challenge reflecting
the order progress, saved in the database as type TIssueState. Several of these
states relate directly to the supplier Acme order status. The states are as follows:

IssStateNone       - Not started, previous order completed or new order failed
                     and needs to be restarted.  Acme supplier status: Invalid.

IssStateChecked    - Basic local checks completed, chosen domain challenge allowed,
                     such as copying a test file to .WellKnown directory or creating
                     an TlsApln certificate, starting the local web server if needed,
                     and then accessing the file or certificate by domain name from
                     the public internet or checking a domain name server can be
                     reached.  Note the Acme Supplier is not accessed at this stage.

IssStateChallgReq  - The order process has started and the supplier has been given
                     a list of domain names and maybe IP addresses to be included
                     in the certificate, and the certificate profile and expiry
                     details, depending on supplier.  If acceptable, an order
                     number is created and a URL for each domain which contains
                     one or more domain challenges. The component selects the
                     appropriate challenge according to the chosen method and will
                     prepare some challenges, others may need to done manually
                     or by the application such as DNS.  The challenges should
                     remain valid for up to a week, the expiry date is shown
                     on the Supplier Order tab. Acme supplier status: Pending.

IssStateChallgWaitTest - Does not appear to be used at present.

IssStateChallgTest - Challenges have been tested locally as ready for checking by
                     supplier, .WellKnown and TlsApln have been accessed from the
                     public internet or the DNS returns the correct TXT record.
                     The supplier order is ready to start. Acme supplier status:
                     Pending.

IssStateChallgPend - The order process has started and the supplier has been asked
                     to check the order domain challenges.  Waiting for a response
                     from the certificate supplier to the challenges, may happen
                     within 15 seconds, but each challenge is accessed from multiple
                     servers around the world so may take longer.  DNS challenges
                     sometimes take longer to propagate to secondary DNS servers.
                     Acme supplier status: Pending.

IssStateChallgOK   - All domain challenges have been passed by the supplier who is
                     now ready to accept a certificate supply request (CSR) and
                     issue the CA signed certificate. Acme supplier status: Ready.

IssStateFinalPend  - All domain challenges have been passed by the supplier who is
                     now ready to accept a certificate supply request (CSR) and
                     issue the CA signed certificate. Acme supplier status: Ready.

ssStateIssuePend   - The order has been accepted and finalised, but there is now
                     a short delay while the new certificate is issued, perhaps a
                     queue is the supplier is busy. Acme supplier status: Processing.

IssStateIssued     - The new certificate has been issued and is ready to be
                     collected by the component.  This normally happens
                     automatically. Acme supplier status: Valid.

IssStateCollect    - The new certificate has been collected OK, and all the
                     various certificate files, private keys, etc, have been
                     created and copied to the specified directories.  The
                     certificate can be collected again if something failed
                     for a few days, usually. Acme supplier status: Valid.

IssStateFinished   - The new certificate has been collected OK and the supplier
                     has finished with this order, so it can not be collected
                     again. Acme supplier status: Invalid.

IssStateCancel     - Cancelled order, perhaps revoked certificate, so can not
                     collect certificate again.


TSslX509Certs Sample Application
--------------------------------

There is a application Samples\demos-delphi-vcl\OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst.dpr
that illustrates all the functionality of the TSslX509Certs component, allowing
certificates to be ordered and collected by clicking a few buttons.   The
sample also shows all certificates ordered by ICS components and saved in the
supplier account databases and allows them to be re-ordered.


Tab: Acme Suppliers
-------------------

The 'Acme Suppliers' tab shows all the supplier accounts created with their
details, and which allows new accounts to be created or old ones deleted.  If
upgrading from ICS 9.4 or earlier, use the 'Import Old Account' button to
import the old Let's Encrypt account into a new supplier 'AcmeLetsEncrypt-Old'.

A supplier account must be opened by double clicking on the list or clicking
Open Supplier Account before orders may be viewed.  There is an inactivity
Account Close Timeout on the Account Common tab, that closes accounts in
case applications attempt to access them, since there is currently no account
locking, defaults to five minutes.

To create a new Acme Supplier, select the Acme Supplier Name from the list,
a default Account Title and Account Directory will be filled but can be changed
if required.  Most suppliers offers live and staging servers, the latter is
best for testing since it issue certificates signed by a fake CA and there are
fewer rate limits than the live server which may get blocked if you make
too many mistakes during ordering. When 'Save New Account' is clicked, the
Supplier Details tab will appear for more supplier information.


Tab: Supplier Details
---------------------

The 'Supplier Details' tab specifies the type of private and public keys
for the account, Elliptic Curve secp256 is smallest so best. These keys
are used to authenticate the account to the supplier, using a Json Web Key
created from the private key to sign each POST request with a Json Web
Signature, no user name is needed.

HTTP proxy URL is if the server is behind a NAT firewall so does not have a
public address, the URL format is 'http://host:port' where :port is optional.

Let's Encrypt does not require any email or external accounting information,
but these are needed for most other suppliers, taken from the console where
you created an ACME account, see details about different suppliers earlier.

Socket Family is generally Any, unless the account should only be accessed
over IPv4 or IPv6 specifically.  The Account Local Web Server is only needed
if the sample uses the ChallFileSrv or ChallAlpnSrv challenges to locally
order certificates without using a separate web server, for domains whose
address is this server.  Select the server IP addresses, they may be public
addresses or LAN if there is a NAT router forwarding an external IP to this
PC, as is often done for development and testing. If the domain has both
IPv4 (A) and IPv6 (AAAA) records, both family IP addresses must be specified,
since they are both tested.  The local web server is only started when order
processing starts and closed immediately after, but will not start if any
other server is using the same IP addresses.

There are various logging options, to keep track of activity and for
diagnostics when things don't work as expected, if the Log Directory is
not blank.  There are several levels of debug logging from just connections,
through SSL negotiations, then HTTP headers and content, also Json logging for
protocol errors (or changes).

Click Save Supplier Details and the component will attempt to create an
account or check it already exists.  The account number will appear on
the tab, but is not really used for anything.


Tab: Accounts Common
--------------------

The Accounts Common tab contains information common to all accounts on the
PC, mostly specific to this sample.

Log Directory if not blank is where the sample will write a daily log file
of all activity in the sample, as shown in the log window.  This directory
does not apply to other applications using the component, they must
implement their own logging.  Account Close Timeout is how long the sample
keeps an account open for, default five minutes.  DNS Challenge can be
selected as Local Windows DNS Server or Cloudflare DNS Server, but the
latter is not yet supported, this applies when usinng the DNS Automatic
challenges that only work if this server has a Windows DNS Server hosting
the domain records for which an order is being placed, which will be
accessed using WMI functions.

Private Key File Encryption specifies the type of encyption and password
for any private key files generated, nearly always AES256.  Note the
password is not encrpyted in the database files.  It is primarily to
allow private keys to be imported into Windows Store.  Default password
is 'password'.


Tab: Supplier Orders - View Orders
----------------------------------

Once an old Suppler account is opened, the 'Supplier Orders' tab shows all
the orders created for that account, and has buttons to start edit old
orders to review certificates.  To start a new local order, skip this tab
and go straight to the Cert Domain tab.

The order lists shows the Common Name, Order Date, Issue State,  Order Id,
Issued Date, Expiry Date, Renew From Date, Challenge Type, Profile and
Subject Alternate Names. Clicking on an order row shows further details
with certificate dates and challenge details, maybe error for failures.

Orders for local server challenges can be started from this tab, old
orders deleted or revoked, or old orders opened for limited editing.


Tab: Cert Domain
----------------

A new local order can be created by opening a Supplier Account, and selecting
the 'Cert Domain' tab. Specify the Certificate Domain Common Name and any
Subject Alternate Names, the sample application will add the Common Name to
the SAN list if not done manually. If Domain Challenge is for UNC file, set
the Web Server UNC HTTP .Well-Known Directory' for the Common Name, and
optionally for each SAN if different.

If the final certificates are to be copied to the web server, set the Web
Server UNC Public Certificates Directory.  There are various Output
Certificate Formats that may be ticked or unticked to reduce the number
of unneeded files, Separate PEM Files, PEM Bundle File, PKCS12/PFX Bundle
File, PKCS7 Bundle File and CSR PEM File.

Windows Cert Store means the final certificate will be installed into the
specified Windows Certificate Store for use by IIS web servers or other
servers. The two stores are Current User or Local Machine Store, the latter
needs Admin Rights for the sample if used for local orders, the former is
not available for most Windows Services.


Tab: Cert Admin
---------------

The 'Cert Admin' tab contains further information needed for a new certificate
order.  All certificates need to specify a Private Key Type and Size depending
on security requirements, RSA2048 used to be common but Elliptic Curve secp256
is smaller and more common now. Signature Digest Type usually SHA256. Serial
Number Type is only used for Own CA orders, and is either random or sequential
(stored in the database).

Most of the other admin fields, names, addresses, email, phone nummber, etc
are for commercial certificates only, not domain validated certificates, and
may be ignored.


Tab: Supplier New Order - Settings
----------------------------------

Once the Cert Domain and Cert Admin tabs have been completed for a new order,
click on the 'Supplier New Order' tab.  Specify the 'Domain Challenge Method',
details of which were discussed above but are: File - Web Server UNC (external),
File - Web Server FTP (manual), File - Local Web Server (built in), File - App
Web Server (ICS server), DNS Automatic, DNS Account Automatic,  DNS manual,
Email Manually (not supported), TLS-ALPN - Web UNC (external), TLS-ALPN -
Local Web (built-in) TLS-ALPN - App Web (ICS server).

Certificate CSR Origin specifies whether the component should create a
new private key and CSR for a new order, or use files previously created, in
which case both should be specified and many properties will be ignored.  Click
the 'Check CSR' button to read the files and check they contain the correct
domain and the key matches.  Normally used for commercial orders only.

Automatic Order Completion being ticked means the component will check every
few seconds to see if an order is ready for collection and finish it
automatically.

Cert Profile or Type is currently for Let's Encrypt only and customises the
certificate.  'Classic' is the original 90 days expiry certificate, 'tlsserver'
is a simpler certificate missing the common name which is always duplicated
in the list of Alternate Subject Names. 'Shortlived' is a 160 hour (6.6 days)
expiring certificate that may also include IP addresses, currently only from
the test staging server, due for public use in late 2025.  There is also a
tlsclient profile but this disappears in early 2026.  The profiles also
change order validity periods, classic authorisations remains valid for seven
days but that is reduced to one hour new newer profile, order lifetime used
to be seven days, but is now eight hours.

Certificate Period (days) is currently for Google certificates only, instead
of the Profile used by Let's Encrypt, to specify the expiry period, anywhere
from three to 90 days at present, but the maximum will reduce over the next
few years. Very useful to allow testing short lived renewals today.

Once the order settings are specified, click the 'Save Order' button to
update the account database.  The 'Check Order' button may be clicked to
locally check the order, see below.


Tab: Supplier New Order - Local Order
-------------------------------------

The 'Supplier New Order' tab has a series of buttons labelled with steps 1 to
7 that allow the sample to order a certificate using the Local Web Server
specified for the acccount, with Local Web File or ALPN, or DNS Automatic
challenges (if the server has a public Windows Domain Name Server).  Local
orders may also be started from the  Supplier Order tab, but some of these
seven steps are combined so there only five buttons.  Buttons are greyed and
unresponsive until prior order steps are compeleted, and may by bypassed
if Automatic Order Completion is selected with the buttons being enabled in
sequence as the order progresses, often completed in less than one minute.

Clicking 'Check Order (1)' which will check the challenge method is valid for
a local order by the sample, will then create local test challenges for all
domains specified and make HTTP requests to those domains to ensure they are
accessible from the public internet.

Generally, the sample will be run on a PC or server with public internet
addresses.  But for testing, the PC or server might only have LAN IP
addresses, with a NAT firewall forwarding public request to the LAN IPs.
In this case, it may be necessary to use a public HTTP proxy server to
access the public IP addresses, set-up on the Supplier Details tab.

If the local challenges are not accessible, there is no point in the order
being placed since it fail.  If the domains are accessible, the Order Issue
State changes to Checked, and the order can be started.

Clicking 'Start Order (2)' will to start the order process with the supplier.
They are asked to issue challenges for each of the domain names requested,
which the component then prepares and writes to queue records in the database.
As discussed above, challenges may include writing server files, creating
special SSL certificates or adding records to a Domain Name Server.
Previously satisfied challenges remain valid for a period varying from eight
hours to 30 days (for classic certificates) so the supplier may report the
challenges already complete at the this stage.

Once the challenges are ready, Acme Order State becomes Pending, and the
Order Issue State changes to ChallgReq.

Clicking 'Test Challenges (3)' starts testing the supplier challenges, to
make sure the domains, files, etc are available from the public internet
correctly, effectively repeating 'Check Order' but with real challenges.
Once successful the Order Issue State changes to ChallgTest.

Clicking 'Start Challenges (4)' asks the supplier to test the challenges,
which usually takes from 15 seconds to a minute, unless they are very busy.
There are usually several challenge tests from different networks in
different countries.  The Order Issue State will be updated to ChallgPend.
For HTTP challenges, the log window will display activity for the local
web server, which should be receiving and responding to multiple page
requests.

If Automatic Order Completion is enabled, the component will check the
Order Status (next button) for successful or failed challenges every five
seconds while the sample application is running, waiting for the Acme
Order Status to change from Pending to Ready, then updating Issue Status
to ChallgOK when that happens.

Clicking 'Order Status (5)' makes a request to the supplier to check the
Acme Order Status which will change from Pending to Ready once the challenges
for all domains have been successfully tested.  The Order Issue State then
changes to FinalPend.  If any challenges fail, the Order Issue State changes
to None and the order must be restarted.   The Supplier Orders tab should
display the reason for failure, usually just unable to acccess the public
server.

Clicking 'Finalize Order (6)' is only possible once all challenges are
checked by the supplier and the Order Issue State is ChallgOK or FinalPend.
The component creates a new private key and certificate signing request
using the domain details and sends a request to supplier to finalize the
order.  The supplier then matches the CSR against approved domain challenge
and commences issue of a new certificate, which may take a few seconds. The
Acme Order status changes to Processing and Order Issue State to IssuePend.
Clicking 'Order Status (5)' again will check the Acme Order Status which
changhes to Valid once the certificate is issued, with Order Issue State
to Issued. If Automatic Order Completion is enabled, this happens
automatically.

Clicking 'Collect Certificate (7)' is only possible once Order Issue State
is Issued.  The new SSL/TLS certificate is downloaded with any intermediate
certificates needed to validate the trust chain.  The component then creates
several files including the order number containing certificate, private
keys, bundles, etc, depending on the 'Output Certificate Format' settings
on the Cert Domain tab.  Finally the component runs a check to validate
the certificate chain, and reports all the details in the log. If validation
passes, all the files are saved a second time without the order number, as
detailed above and the Order Issue State updated to Collected.  If a Web
Server UNC Public Certificate Directory has been specified, the certificates
will be copied to the servers.

Finally, the component will ask the supplier for Renewal Information for the
certificate.  This specifies how many days before expiry a certificate should
be renewed, and how often these dates should be rechecked to see if the
certificate needs immediate renewal due to being revoked. These dates are
reported on the Supplier Orders tab.  Recheck is usually between six and 24
hours and is done automatically by ICS servers.

Beware the account database is not designed to shared between multiple
applications running at the same time.  So it is better for each application
that will order certificates to use a separate Acme account and directory,
and only use the sample application to briefly check orders.

Tab: Supplier Orders - Start or Revoke Orders
---------------------------------------------

Back to the Supplier Order tab, there are various buttons, some of which
match the supplier New Order tab and do the same thing, others combine tasks.

Check Order - if the order use challenges FileApp or AlpnApp for a server,
just enables the Start Order button.  For a local order, does as it
suggests, checking local challenges.

Start Order - if the order use challenges FileApp or AlpnApp for a server,
a flag is set in the account database that will be checked next time the
server check renewal information, and will start an immediate order,
may take several hours since the database is not checked regularly.  For
a local order, starts the order, gets and checks the challenges, then
asks the supplier to check the challenges.  If Automatic Order Completion
is enabled, Order status is checked every five secondss and everything
just happens until the order is completed.

Order Status - as above.

Finalise Order - as above.

Collect Order - as above.

Cancel Order - allows an order to be stopped part way through the process.

Revoke Certificate - if a certificate has been issued but should no longer
be trustedi, it may be revoked.  Revoking an order should generally only be
done if the certificate is in public use and the private key has been
compromised.  Revoke means the certificate will be added to supplier CRL
databases which may be checked by browsers to prevent compromised
certificates being trusted until expiry. The reduced issue period of
certificates is partly to avoid then needing to be revoked.

Remove Order - clears an old order from the supplier database but does not
revoke the certificate.

Reset Order - sometimes challenge failure can mean the order gets stuck
and not complete or do anything useful, so this button resets the Issue
State to none so it can be restarted.

Renewal Information - works for all unexpired collected or finished
orders. Ask the supplier for Renewal Information for the certificate.
This specifies how many days before expiry a certificate should be
renewed, and how often these dates should be rechecked to see if the
certificate needs immediate renewal due to being revoked.

Edit Order - loads the selected order into Cert Domain, Cert Admin
and Supplier New Order tabs, allowing some settings to be changed
and saved by the 'Save Order' button on the New Order tab.  While
this works for local orders, those created by servers may change
the order information according to the IcsHosts and server settings.

List Challenges - for an order in progress, will log the state of
challenges being tested.

Redistribute - for a collected order, redistributes the certificate
files according to the 'Output Certificate Format' settings.


Tab: Own CA
------------------- -

For internal network use and testing, it is possible to issue your own
SSL/TLS certificates for devices that are not accessible from the public
internet.  These can be self signed certificates, but to try and avoid
horrible browser warnings it is better to issue certificates signed by
trusted root CA certificate that is installed in the Windows Store (and
maybe other stores) as a trusted root on each device that will access
servers running certificates issued by the CA.

ICS now has it's own SSL root certificate 'ICS Root CA' and two intermediates, 'ICS
Intermediate' and 'ICS Intermediate Short', the last of which includes a private key
so can be used to automatically sign new certificates by ICS server applications,
rather than just self signed certificates as before. If the 'ICS Root CA' certificate
is installed in the Window Store and browser stores, it should stop certificate
warnings appearing. ICS applications automatically trust the ICS root, so will give
no warnings. The short intermediate has a maximum 200 day expiry, so new versions will
be issued regularly. There is a single function CreateSelfSignCertEx that creates
signed certificates, and another IcsInstallIcsRoot that installs the ICS root into
the Windows Store, so easy to use. It is possible to replace the ICS root with your
own private root certificate and have servers create their own certificates against
that root, for internal networks.

The ICS SSL root certificate is loaded automatically with the SslRootCAStore.Initialise
function that loads the CA Root Store, and with the define OpenSSL_AutoLoad_CA_Bundle,
to verify any ICS issued certificates.  The SslRootCAStore.Initialise functions also
tries to load the file C:\ProgramData\ICS-OpenSSL\ExtraRootCABundle.pem which is an
optional private root bundle that can be used for private customer or developer root
CA certificates, in PEM format.

Alternatively, you can create your own certificate authority and intermediate
to sign your own certificates.

The sample application has a button that will create self signed SSL certificates
with a 'CA Cert' check box so it can sign other certificates., but the
OverbyteIcsPemTool sample has more control over fields. You should create a new
private key and self signed certificate with your organisation's common name,
ie Magenta Development CA.  Rather than signing certificates directly with the
new trusted CA, it is better create an intermediate CA signed by the trusted CA,
allowing variations of key types and digests, ie Magenta Intermediate EC CA1.
The intermediate CA certificate does not need to be installed on client devices,
only the trusted CA.

On the Own CA tab, the Certificate Directory should be specified, note the
account database for Own CA certificates currently does not store certificate
details so they can not be ordered automatically by TWSocketServer. Then specify
the CA Certificate or Bundle File and CA Private Key File (if not in bundle) and
click the 'Load CA'  button check and load it, with Issued to and Issued by
being shown.

To issue your own signed SSL certificates, the usual settings on the Cert Domain
and Cert Admin tabs should be completed, and the 'CA Signed Cert' button pressed.
The component will then create a new private key and CSR files, then a new
certificate signed by the Own CA, in a process otherwise identical to collecting
an ACME certificate, using a sequential order number, with files saved with and
without the order number and optionally distributed to the web server.  Note
this sample sets common certificate extensions only, for more control you
should create your own CSR using OverbyteIcsPemTool or it's functions.

Each certificate signed by the Own CA is logged to the index.txt database file
in the Certificate Directory, in OpenSSL CA command format, which is tab
delimited with status, expiry date, SHA1 fingerprint, file name, subject and
subject alternate names. This file could be updated if the certificate is
revoked and used to support Certificate Revocation Lists (not implemented).


TSslX509Certs: Main Methods for Accounts and Orders
---------------------------------------------------

The TSslX509Certs component provides many methods for dealing with accounts
and the database, which relate closely to the buttons on the Orders tab.
These functions are used by the TSslWSocketServer methods DoCheckOrderCert and
DoProcOrderCert which are how severs using IcsHosts order certificates.

function DBSuppliersRead: Boolean;

Opens and read the Acme Supplier Database C:\ProgramData\ICS-Acme-Accounts\ics-acme-accounts.db
into an array of AcmeSuppRecs records.


function DBFindAccSupp(const ATitle: String): Integer;

Searches for a Supplier Title in the AcmeSuppRecs records, returning the index if
found, or -1.  The application should set the component properties:
X509Cert.CertDirWork := AcmeSuppRecs[Idx].ASuppDir;
X509Cert.AcmeSupplier := AcmeSuppRecs[Idx].ASupplier;


function SetAcmeAccount(CreateNew: Boolean = False): Boolean;

Opens the supplier account as in CertDirWork, optionally creating a new
account for AcmeSupplier if the directory does not exist or is empty.
For a new account, several properties can be set: DebugLevel, DomWebSrvIP,
LogJson, LogPkeys, SupplierEmail, SupplierProto, SupplierServer.

Once the account is opened, the property DomainItems returns an array of
TDomainItems containing the main details of each domain record in the database,
and an event is triggered whenever this changes.

The function will fail if ics-control.db can not be found or the working
directory mismatches the database. Call ClearAccount before using this.


function CloseAccount: Boolean;

Close the account, if open.


function DBReadCNDomain(const CNDomain: String): Boolean;

For an open supplier account, reads all the properties for an order with
the Common Name from the account database, if found, including one or more
subject alternate names.

The function will fail if the domain has not been saved in the database.
Call ClearCertOrder before using this.


function DBWriteCNDomain: Boolean;

Save or update properties for CertCommonName certificate to the account database.
There are many possible properties, all of which are illustrated in the sample
application.  The main properties are: CertCommonName, AcmeSupplier,
SuppCertChallenge, CertPKeyType, CertSignDigest, CertCsrOrigin, CertSerNumType,
CertOutFmts, DirWellKnown, DirPubWebCert, PrivKeyPassword, PrivKeyCipher,
CertSubAltNames, CertAcmeProfile and CertValidity (Google only).

Fails if account not opened, but does not check properties for validity.


function AcmeCheckSaveOrder(DomainCheck: Boolean = True; UpdateDB: Boolean = False): Boolean;

This is the main function to start a certificate order, used by the
'Check Order' buttons in the sample.  All required order properties must
have been read using DBReadCNDomain or set as properties, and will be saved
using DBWriteCNDomain if UpdateDB is set.  It checks the Common Name is
included in the SANs and adds it if not, then checks the challenge method
and SAN number are supported by the certificate product.

This function restarts the order process for an old order setting Order
Issue State changes to None, even if old challenges are still valid.
If DomainCheck is true, checks the domain is accessible from the public
internet for domain challenges.  If the domains are accessible, the
Order Issue State changes to Checked, and the order can be started.


function AcmeV2GetChallgs: Boolean;

This is the main function to place a certificate order with the supplier,
used by the 'Start Order' buttons in the sample. AcmeCheckSaveOrder must
have passed first.   The supplier provides challenges for each domain in
the order which the components prepares and the Order Issue State changes
to ChallgReq.


function AcmeV2TestChallgs: Boolean;

Once challenges have been acquired from the supplier, this function locally
tests them, called by the 'Test Challenges' button.  Once done OK, the Order
Issue State changes to ChallgTest.


function AcmeV2StartChallgs: Boolean;

Once the challenges have been tested, this function asks the supplier to
test them, called by the 'Start Challenges' button. Testing usually takes
from 15 seconds to a minute, sometimes a lot longer, and the Order Issue
State will be updated to ChallgPend. If Automatic Order Completion is
enabled, the component will check the Order Status for successful or
failed challenges every five seconds waiting for the Acme Order Status
to change from Pending to Ready, then updating Issue Status to ChallgOK
when that happens, and then calling AcmeV2OrderFinal and AcmeV2CollectCert.


function AcmeV2OrderStatus: Boolean;

Requests the Acme order status at any point during the order process,
but in particular when waiting for something to happen, called by
the five second timer that runs Automatic Order Completion to check
for status changes with the Order Issue State updated appropriately.
Called by the 'Order Status 'button'.


function AcmeV2OrderFinal(LogErrors: Boolean = True): Boolean;

Once the challenges have all been tested by the supplier, the order
can be finalised, called by the 'Finalize Order' button.  The component
creates a new private key and certificate signing request using the domain
details and sends a request to supplier to finalize the order.  The
supplier then matches the CSR against approved domain challenge and
commences issue of a new certificate, which may take a few seconds.
The Order Issue State becomes IssuePend. If Automatic Order Completion
is enabled, the component will wait for the certificate to be issued
by checking AcmeV2OrderStatus for Order Issue State Issued.


function AcmeV2CollectCert: Boolean;

Once the certificate is issued by the supplier, it may be collected,
called by the 'Collect Certificate' button or by Automatic Order
Completion'.  The new SSL/TLS certificate is downloaded with any
intermediate certificates needed to validate the trust chain.  The
component then creates several files depending on the 'Output
Certificate Format' settings, runs a check to validate the certificate
chain and the Order Issue State updated to Collected.  If a Web
Server UNC Public Certificate Directory has been specified, the
certificates will be copied to the servers.


function DBReadCNDomDates(const CNDomain: String): Boolean;

Similar to DBReadCNDomain but only reads sufficient properties to
check certificate renewal and whether the Acme supplier should
be contacted to update renewal information.


function CertRenewalDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

Only available if a previously issued certificate is available, asks
the Acme supplier how many days before expiry the certificate should
be renewed.


function CertCancelDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

For an order with issue state Collected or Installed, will cancel the order
with the supplier, which may result in a refund if done within a reasonable
period.


function CertRevokeDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

For an order with issue state Collected or Installed, will cancel and revoke the
order with the supplier.


function CertRemoveDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

Removes any order from the database, to stop further processing or re-use.


function CertRedistDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

For an order with issue state Collected or Installed, copies the certificate
files to the web server again, if lost.

                         rather than writing files.
                       Builds without USE_SSL
Nov 12, 2019 - V8.63 - OpenAccount will now create a new account correctly.
                       Better response for CertOrderDomain if order collected.
                       Changed challenge checking from every 30 seconds to 10 seconds
                         after a challenge started for faster completion.
                       Clear Acme nonce after errors so a fresh nonce is found.
                       Added AutoAccountClose property so account is closed after
                         order is completed or fails and AccountTimeOutMins to
                         close it anyway when idle.  This avoids potential hacking
                         attempts that often follow listing in SSL certificate
                         transparency logs immediately after issue.
                       Improved local web server and REST logging.
                       Added LastError to try and keep the last real order error.
                       Expire and remove challenges from the database after 24 hours
                         or a week for manual/email/dns.
May 18, 2020 - V8.64 - Added support for International Domain Names for Applications (IDNA),
                         i.e. using accents and unicode characters in domain names.
                       X509 certificates always have A-Lavels (Punycode ASCII) domain names,
                        never UTF8 or Unicode.   IDNs are converted back to Unicode
                       Fixed bug that stopped new orders after a successful one
                         saying no more today, due to date not being cleared.
                       Allow use of EC keys for ACME account, still don't work yet.
                       Added sanity check for private key type and check private
                          key is generated OK.
                       With automatic order completion don't report errors if the
                         challenges are not actually started, may take several minutes
                         for manual DNS updating.
                       The onChallengeDNS/Email/FTP events have an extra parameter
                         ChlgOK which the application should set once the challenge
                         have been set-up, so the component can stop if necessary.
                         Sorry, this requires application changes.
                       Now storing wildcard and host challenges separately, so they
                         can be used together for the same domain.
                       Fixed several literal typos, sorry.
                       Support tls-alpn-01 challenge for local web server on 443.
                       WebSrvHttp event to check http-01 ChallFileApp well-known
                         challenge without neding to save a file.
                       Avoid possible logging exception with StopDomSrv during destroy.
                       Added testing DNS challenges against public DNS servers.
                       Major restructure of ordering process so that challenges are
                         obtained and locally tested before the Acme order process
                         starts, Acme challenges are valid for seven days, so
                         this allows manual DNS challenges to be set-up and tested
                         later.
                       Implemented SelfSigned function to create certificate from
                         properties, optionally as a CA (for Own CA).
                       Implement AcmeV2OrderCancel to cancel order and revoke order,
                         former useful to remove old challenges (which remain valid
                         for a week or more) so fresh challenges can be tested.
Dec 09, 2020 - V8.65 - Using new SuperObject DateTime methods.
                       Better validation for remote certificate directories.
                       Better logging when waiting for challenges to complete.
                       Remove old challenges when starting new Acme order,
                         but leave fake DNS record.
                       Save local server IP address with domains, and check using
                         correct address, may be different for different orders.
                       Added extra IssStateChallgWaitTest.
                       Close local web server before collecting certificate to stop
                         hacking immediately certificate issued (and listed in
                         certificate transparency log).
                       Builds without AUTO_X509_CERTS, without some functionality.
                       Renamed Ics.Posix.Messages.pas to Ics.Posix.PXMessages.pas.
Mar 23, 2021 - V8.66 - Bad version.
                       When starting local web server, check server IP address still
                         exists or change to 0.0.0.0, may not work if multiple IPs exist.
                       Minor fixes to file challenges, thanks to Oliver Dahlmann.
Sep 22, 2021 - V8.67 - Improved error messages if testing challenge fails.
                       OpenSSL 3.0 makes several old ciphers and digests legacy so default
                         for encrypting PFX/P12 files is now PrivKeyEncAES256 with 3.0
                         unless the legacy DLL is loaded when still PrivKeyEncTripleDES
                         so older versions of Windows can load them.
                       Changed extraction of download PEM bundle so that main certificate
                         does not need to be first in file, log them all, ignore any
                         self signed root certificates.
                       If testing dns-01 challenge fails, rotate to next public server
                         and three retries (previously only happened on timeout).
                       When saving files with private keys, log encryption type used.
                       Another attempt as consistently formatted literals, fewer capitals.
                       Added more certificate output formats, OutFmtPwPem and OutFmtPwP12
                         specify whether to password PEM and P12/PFX private keys. Note
                         Windows always needs passworded P12/PRX files, while Apache web
                         server only accepts PEM files without a password.
                       Allow automatic installation of new certificates to the Windows
                         Certificate Store so they can be used by IIS web sites, by
                         setting output format to OutFmtWinStore.  Note application must
                         have administrator rights to do this.
                       Truncate certificate chain info to 1,000 bytes avoid overloading
                         database INI file.
                       Check new certificate bundles can actually be opened.
Dec 20, 2021 - V8.68 - Added property KeepOldCA set true to keep LA intermediate for
                         expired DST Root CA X3 root in bundles (for old Androids).
                         Keeping it may prevent some clients verifying the chain and
                         SslLabs testing gives a chain warning.
                       HttpRest now allows saving a file, so change Acme terms to do so.
Apr 05, 2022 - V8.69 - Builds on MacOS again, MsSslUtils is Windows only so don't attempt
                         to install certificate into Windows store on Mac.
                       Added unit OverbyteIcsSslHttpOAuth for stuff previously in HttpRest.
                       When revoking certificate, look for bundle file if single file missing.
Aug 23, 2022 - V8.70 - Create well known directory if missing for ALPN challenges.
                       Ignore ACME zero length error in AcmeGetRequest.
Jul 06, 2022 - V8.71 - Removed OAuth2 authentication code from the component and instead get
                         authentication token using OnX509OAToken event from main application.
                         OAuth2 is only needed for CertCentre, so this avoid linking a lot of
                         code for applications that only need Let's Encrypt.
                       Note CertCentre no longer offers Comondo/Sectigo certificates.
                       Using Int64 ticks.
                       Local web server now supports IPv6 addresses.
                       Added DomWebSrvIP2 second local web server IP so it can listen on
                         both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for domains with both.  To use the
                         second address with existing saved domains in the database, they
                         must be deleted and resaved.
                       Simplified checking DNS challenges with sync method, but repeat
                         DNS query six times in case of missing response to new TXT
                         challenges, DNS servers seem to randomly ignore TXT records.
                       Better sanity check checking challenges after order.
                       Added MsCertLoc property to specify which Windows Certificate Store
                         to save certificate if OutFmtWinStore is specified, may be
                         MsLocMachine (default) or MsLocCurUser which does not need admin
                         rights.
Aug 08, 2023 V9.0  Updated version to major release 9.
Jan 27, 2024 V9.1  Make sure certificate extensions are set for server certificate before
                     creating certificate request so international domain name with accents
                     gets processed, got broken in June 2023 due to change in DoCertReqProps.
                   Added OverbyteIcsSslBase which now includes TX509Base and TX509List.
                   Validation now uses public IcsSslRootCAStore and ignores root bundle.
                   OwnCASign to sign our own certificates with OwnCA now creates
                     intermediates as well.
                   OwnCASign now adds signing certificate as intermediate to bundle.
                   Using TBytes Jose functions where possible.
Apr 10, 2024 V9.2  Added function CertResetDomain to reset an order state to None, if
                     the order process stalls or gets confused due to errors.
                   If AcmeV2StartChallgs fails because there are no pending challenges,
                     reset to order to None so it starts again next time and does not loop.
                   No warning message if local web server is using 0.0.0.0 or ::.
Aug 08, 2024 V9.3  Made all output file names available as properties, ie FileCertPem.
                   No longer prefer TripleDES for P12 files, too old.
                   Undefining MSCRYPT_Tools stops TSslX509Certs saving certifates to the
                     Windows Store.
Feb 10, 2025 V9.4  Updated Base64 encoding functions to IcsBase64 functions.
                   Removed Ics.Posix.PXMessages, not needed here.
                   Change 3DES cipher to AES256 if legacy provider is not loaded, really
                     cosmetic since the AES256 would be used anyway.
Sep 09, 2025 V9.5  Removed CertCentre Json ordering (lots of code), now integrated into
                     Digicert CertCentral which supports Acmev2.  Simplified component by
                     removing some common functions that called Acme or CertCentral since
                     no longer needed, see below.
                   Since Let's Encrypt introduced the Acme protocol, other suppliers have
                     added automated ordering using the same API, mostly with extra account
                     information for commercial certificates, so added several of these.
                   AcmeSupplier is possible supplier types TAcmeSupplier: AcmeLetsEncrypt,
                     AcmeLetsEncryptTest, AcmeZeroSSL, AcmeGoogle, AcmeGoogleTest,
                     AcmeDigicert, AcmeDigicertTest, AcmeSslcomRSA, AcmeSslcomECC.
                     Note most need an external account to be created before Acme can be used,
                     with AcmeEABKid and AcmeEABHmacKey specified to access the APIs. Most
                     suppliers offer API testing endpoints, with Test at the end. The status
                     of AcmeSupplier testing is detailed near the top of this unit.
                   ICS now has a central Acme database that contains a list of the Acme work
                     directories previously only referenced in separate IcsHosts INI files:
                      C:\ProgramData\ICS-Acme-Accounts\ics-acme-accounts.db
                   By default, new work directories will be in: C:\ProgramData\ICS-Acme-Accounts\
                   Added function AcmeV2RenewalInfo which for an existing certificate order,
                     finds when renewal is recommended, uses CertRenewalId built from certificate
                     Authority Key Id and serial number, calculates CertRenewDays from old
                     certificate expiry date, CertRenewNow=true if renew immediately, sets
                     CertRenewRetryDT which is when this request should be retried for fresh
                     information, for instance if the certificate is revoked, usually every six hours.
                   Added ClearAccount and ClearAccount to centralise resetting everything.
                   DBReadCNDomain no longer has the option to skip reading order properties
                     set manually which was used in AcmeCheckOrder.
                   AcmeCheckOrder renamed AcmeCheckSaveOrder, before calling it you must call
                     DBReadCNDomain and update any new properties for the order.
                   AcmeV2GetCert split into three functions, AcmeV2OrderStatus, AcmeV2OrderFinal
                      and AcmeV2CollectCert.
                   AcmeV2CheckChallg and ChallengeTimer are no longer used since the order process
                     no longer checks individual challenges are finished, AcmeV2OrderStatus
                     instead checks if all challenges finished.
                   CertCheckDomain and CertSaveDomain have gone, use AcmeCheckSaveOrder instead.
                   CertReadDomain has gone, use DBReadCNDomain instead.
                   CertGetChallgDomain has gone, use AcmeV2GetChallg.
                   CertOrderDomain has gone, use AcmeV2StartChallgs instead.
                   CertCollectDomain has gone, use AcmeV2OrderFinal and AcmeV2Collect instead.
                   Google allows certificate CertValidity expiry to be specified in days, always
                     part of the Acme spec, but Let's Encrypt did not support it.
                   Supporting asynchronous order finalization, part of Acme spec. If AcmeV2OrderFinal
                    returns 'processing' status set IssStateIssuePend, call AcmeV2OrderStatus
                     until IssStateIssued, then call AcmeV2CollectCert. Required by Google and
                     Let's Encrypt staging, but introduction by Let's Encrypt production delayed
                     in April 2023 by too few clients supporting it, including ICS!.
                   Implemented the onChallgRefresh event which is called when the Acme order
                     object status changes, usually after Acme methods are called, but also
                     while waiting for challenges or orders to complete.
                   Added new ChallengeDNSAcnt for the dns-account-01 challenge that adds an
                     account hash before _acme-challenge.domain, not tested yet since no
                     suppliers are using it yet.  This challenge is Acme account specific,
                     so different accounts can get certificates for the same domain name.
                   Added property CertRenewNow that if set true in the database using the GUI,
                     will override certificate expiry checking and cause an immediate new
                     certificate replacement order by in servers with IcsHosts the next time
                     RecheckSslCerts is called by the server, typically every two hours.
                   Allow IP addresses for certificate orders as well as host domain names,
                     currently only for Acme Testing with shortlived profile.
                     Only HTTP and APLN challenges, latter needs reversed SNI name ie
                     165.21.168.192.in-addr.arpa
                   Signing Acme requests with Elliptic Curve keys now correctly use IEEE P1363
                     digests so finally work properly, been looking for this since 2018.
                   Let's Encrypt ALPN-01 challenge TLS certificate now requires SAN name or
                     gives OID 2.5.29.17 is not present error.
Sep 18, 2025 V9.5  Added onGeoEvent that allows the application to look-up challenge web server
                     geo information like country and ASN for each new remote connection.
                   Call onChallgRefresh event couple more times, applications doing GEO blocking
                     should check IssueState for IssStateChallgTest/Pend/OK and skip blocking
                     since challenges are checked from several different countries and orders
                     will fail if too many can not connect.
                   If old certificate order dates get lost, get them from old certificate so
                      renew process does not stall.  More logging so we know why order is placed.
                   Failure to collect order like save file errors is fatal, so reset order.
Oct 15, 2025 V9.5  Fixed renewal information being found but reported as not being saved.
                   SupplierEmail is optional for Let's Encrypt, some suppliers may require it.
                   Added IsAccountOpen to simplify checking.
                   DBAddAccSupp adds a new supplier account, optionally creating the Acme
                     account as well, but may fail if not Let's Encrypt due to extra stuff
                     being needed.
                   Updated all documentation.



The docunentation earlier in this unit is repeated with screen shots at:

https://wiki.overbyte.eu/wiki/index.php/FAQ_Order_SSL_Certificates

Pending - IssStateChallgWaitTest does not seem to be used.
Pending - allow only one pending order at once, things may be confused if more than one order trying to collect at the sametime.
Pending - Add self signed and CA certs to database
