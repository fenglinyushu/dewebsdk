History:
Sep 05, 1999 V1.01 Adpted for Delphi 1
Oct 09, 1999 V1.02 Added intermediate class TCustomWSocket
Nov 12, 1999 V1.03 Added OnClientCreate event just after client component has
                   been created.
Apr 02, 2000 V1.04 Added FSessionClosedFlag to avoid double SessionClosed
                   event triggering
Apr 13, 2002 V1.05 When sending banner to client, add LineEnd instead of CR/LF
                   as suggested by David Aguirre Grazio <djagra@xaire.com>
Sep 13, 2002 V1.06 Check if Assigned(Server) in TriggerSessionClosed.
                   Reported by Matthew Meadows <matthew.meadows@inquisite.com>
Sep 16, 2002 V1.07 Fixed a Delphi 1 issue in TriggerSessionClosed where
                   property was used in place of field variable.
Jan 04, 2003 V1.08 Renamed BannerToBusy to BannerTooBusy. This will cause
                   trouble in applications already using this property. You
                   have to rename the property in your app !
Jan 24, 2003 V5.00 Skipped to version 5 because of SSL code
Jan 26, 2004 V5.01 Introduced ICSDEFS.INC and reordered uses for FPC
                   compatibility.
May 01, 2004 V5.02 WMClientClosed was incorrectly referencing global Error
                   variable instead of the real winsock error code. Now pass
                   the errcode in WParam at the time of PostMessage.
                   Removed Forms and Graphics units from the uses clause.
May 23, 2005 V5.03 Added intermediate variable NewHSocket in procedure
                   TriggerSessionAvailable
Dec 30, 2005 V6.00b A.Garrels added IcsLogger
Jan 06, 2008 V6.01 Angus added Disconnect(Client) and DisconnectAll
May 01, 2008 V6.02 A. Garrels - Function names adjusted according to changes in
                   OverbyteIcsLibrary.pas.
May 14, 2008 V6.03 A. Garrels - Type change from String to AnsiString in
                   TWSocketClient (FPeerPort and FPeerAddr).
Aug 11, 2008 V6.04 A. Garrels - Type AnsiString rolled back String.
Nov 6,  2008 V7.00 Angus added CliId property used to ensure correct client freed
                    (did not call it ID to avoid conflicts with existing clients)
Aug 8,  2010 V7.01 FPiette enhanced TriggerSessionAvailable so catch exception
                   in client class constructor and ClientCreate, and close the
                   remote socket in that case.
Feb 4,  2011 V7.02 Angus added bandwidth throttling using TCustomThrottledWSocket.
                   Client sockets inherit server settings for BandwidthLimit and
                   BandwidthSampling, but these can be changed ideally in
                   OnClientCreate event, but also in OnClientConnect but note a
                   timer may have been started by then so better to default to
                   BandwidthLimit=0 and set it, than to disable it.
Apr 15, 2011 V7.03 Arno prepared for 64-bit.
May 13, 2011 V7.04 Anton S. found a small issue with CliId.
May 2012 - V8.00 - Arno added FireMonkey cross platform support with POSIX/MacOS
                   also IPv6 support, include files now in sub-directory
Jul 21, 2012 V8.01 Fix in TCustomMultiListenWSocketServer.TriggerClientConnect.
Jun 03, 2013 V8.02 FPiette added unit "Types" so that some inlines are
                   expanded.
Jun 09, 2013 V8.03 FPiette WMClientClosed clear CliId before freeing.
Aug 18, 2013 V8.04 Arno - It was not possible to clear both string properties
                   Banner and BannerTooBusy in OI since empty strings were not
                   stored in the .dfm.
Aug 18, 2013 V8.05 Arno added some default property specifiers.
Mar 10, 2015 V8.06 Angus CloseDelayed when too many clients so closes cleanly
Mar 23, 2015 V8.07 Angus onSslServerName and OnBgException events set for clients
Oct 26, 2016 V8.36 Angus TWSocketMultiListenItem now has SslEnable moved from SSL class
                   Added extended exception information
Nov 9,  2016  V8.37 Client inherits server SocketErrs
Apr 11, 2017  V8.45 Added multiple SSL host support to TSslWSocketServer.
                    There is a new IcsHosts property which allows multiple hosts
                      to be specified, each with one or two IP addresses and
                      non-SSL and SSL port bindings, SSL certificates and private
                      key, SSL context and security level, and other web server
                      host related properties (not used here).
                    If IcsHosts is specified, TSslWSocketServer ignores existing
                      bindings and SSLContext, and creates new bindings and
                      initialises an SSL context for each host checking and
                      reporting all server certificate chains.
                    IcsHosts includes SslSrvSecurity SSL server security
                       level, that sets protocol, cipher and SslSecLevel according
                       to eight levels from sslSrvSecNone to sslSrvSecHigh192 to
                       avoid needing to set protocols and ciphers in SSL context.
                    IcsHosts includes SslCert, SslKey, SslPassword and SslInter.
                      SslCert may be a file name or a ASCII PEM string containing
                      an Ssl server certificate. The file may be PEM/CER/DER/PFX/P12/etc,
                      either a single certificate or bundle with private key and
                      any intermediates (PEM/PFX/P12 only), SslPassword is the private
                      key password if encrypted.  If a bundle is not found, SslKey is
                      a PEM file or ASCII PEM private key, and SslInters is any
                      intermediate SSL certificates used to sign the server SSL cert
                      as a file name in PEM/CER/DER format or ASCII PEM.
                    TSslWSocketServer has new RootCA property which should be loaded
                      with CA Root certificates to validates the server chain and
                      new DHParams property for a context DHParams file or string.
                    The ValidateHosts property checks all host properties and
                      attempts to validate SSL certificate chains and hosts,
                      it keeps certificate chain information in the IcsHosts CertInfo
                      property and validation warnings or error in ErrInfo.
                    TWSocketClient includes new properties IcsHostIdx, MultiListenIdx
                      and HostTag to identify which IcsHost and MultiListen socket
                      accepted the connection.  Published client server and remote peer
                      address and port as CServerAddr, CServerPort, CPeerAddr and
                      CPeerPort since many clients need this information.
Apr 20, 2017  V8.46 New RootCA property is now a String (filename or base84 string)
                    Improved IcsHost.GetDisplayName a little
                    Set IcsLogger for SSL context
May 16, 2017  V8.47 IcsHosts keeps file time stamps of SSL certs to check if
                      changed, and BindInfo with reportable bindings.
                    Added IcsLoadIcsHostsFromIni function which loads IcsHosts from
                      an open INI file to simplify application creation.
                    Fixed IcsLogger conditional.
May 24, 2017  V8.48 ValidateHosts has options to return all errors as a string
                      instead of raising an exception on the first error.  The idea
                      is that some hosts may still work, even if one or more SSL
                      certificates are bad.
                    Added RecheckSslCerts which shoulld be called at least once a
                      day (after midnight) to check if new SSL certificates are
                      available and if old ones have expired.
                    Added ListenAllOK which returns true if all sockets are listening
                      OK, note starting a multilistener server does not give errors
                      if some listeners fail due to port conflicts.
                    Added ListenStates which returns a multiline string listing the
                       IP, port, SSL and state of all socket listeners.
                    Updated Added IcsLoadIcsHostsFromIni to add web server properties.
June 23, 2017 V8.49 Fixes so we support MacOS again, thanks to Michael Berg.
                    Added more elements to IcsHosts for a .well-known path and
                      web redirection.
                    Added MultiListenEx which opens all possible sockets ignoring
                      errors, which are returned as a string.
Aug 10, 2017  V8.50 Minor clean up
Nov 22, 2017  V8.51 SSL certificate file stamp now stored as UTC date to avoid
                       summer time triggers as file system stamps change
Feb 14, 2018  V8.52 Better error reporting when validating SSL certificates
                    Add TLSv3 ciphers for OpenSSL 1.1.1 and later only
Jun 12, 2018  V8.55 sslSrvSecInter/FS now requires TLS1.1, PCI council EOF TLS1.0 30 June 2018
Jul 6, 2018   V8.56 Added OnSslAlpnSelect called after OnSslServerName for HTTP/2.
Oct 5, 2018   V8.57 Fixed bug so that a newly found SSL certificate is immediately
                      loaded to the context.
                    IcsHosts INI file now accepts enum string for SslSecLevel, ie
                       SslSecLevel=sslSrvSecHigh as well as sslSrvSecHigh=5 .
                    IcsHosts INI file prefers new HostEnabled to older Enabled,
                       avoids confusion with other Enabled properties.
                    Added SslCliCertMethod to allow server to request a client
                       SSL certificate from the browser, NOTE you should check it
                       the OnSslHandshakeDone event and close the connection if
                       invalid, beware this usually causes the browser to request
                       a certificate which can be obtrusive.
                    Allow SSL certificates to be ordered and installed automatically
                       by RecheckSslCerts if SslCertAutoOrder=True and so specified in
                       IcsHosts, if a TSslX509Certs component is attached and a
                       certificate supplier account has been created (by the
                       OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst sample application).
                    Added LoadOneCert which consolidates all certificate loading code
                       from ValidateHosts and RecheckSslCerts.
Oct 19, 2018  V8.58 Increased ListenBacklog property default to 15 to handle
                      higher server loads before rejecting new connections.
                    Documentation on IcsHosts and main components.
Dec 04, 2018  V8.59 Sanity checks reading mistyped enumerated values from INI file.
                    Updated ListenStates so unit compiles without USE_SSL
                    Added AUTO_X509_CERTS define set in OverbyteIcsDefs.inc which
                      can be disabled to remove a lot of units if automatic SSL/TLS
                      ordering is not required, saves up to 350KB of code.
Mar 18, 2019  V8.60 Added WebLogIdx to IcsHosts for web server logging.
                    Added sslSrvSecTls12Less and sslSrvSecTls13Only to disable
                       in server IcsHosts if TLS1.3 fails.
Aug 06, 2019  V8.62 When ordering X509 certificate, ChallFileSrv challenge now
                     uses separate local web server for servers not using ports
                      80 or 443 such as FTP, SMTP, proxies, etc.
                    If IcsHosts SslCert is not found but have a valid directory,
                      try default certificate file name based on Common Name instead,
                      ie www_domain_com.pfx.  Ideally application should check if
                      SslCert changes during ValidateHosts and update persistent
                      storage.
                    Moved BuildCertName here from X509Certs.
                    Added source to HandleBackGroundException so we know where
                        errors come from, when using IcsLogger.
Nov 18, 2019 V8.63 ValidateHosts, RecheckSslCerts and LoadOneCert have new
                     AllowSelfSign to stop errors with self signed certificates.
                   Automatic cert ordering now works if cert file name has -bundle
                     or -cert appended to end.
                   IcsHosts has new AuthSslCmd property for when SSL is allowed
                     on non-SSL port after AUTH SSL command or similar.
                   Automatic cert ordering now closes the account and local web
                     server automatically and after order errors, and when the
                     the server is stopped.
                   Automatic cert ordering now Logs activity via the SslX509Certs
                     component since this one does not have logging.
                   Corrected INI file reading NostEnabled instead of HostEnabled.
May 18, 2020 V8.64 IcsHosts allows NonSSlPort to be zero for random port, not for SSL.
                   Added BindPort read only property with real port while listening.
                   Added BindSrvPort to IcsHosts set while listening.
                   ListenStates now shows BindPort rather than requested port.
                   IcsHosts has new AuthForceSsl property, login only allowed once
                     SSL/TLS negotiated so credentials never sent clear.
                   Added sanity check to OrderClose.
                   Support ChallengeType=ChallAlpnApp for tls-alpn-01 SSL
                      ertificate challenge, client has new OnClientAlpnChallg
                      event that should provide the new self signed ACME certificate
                      for the challenge sent using a temporary SslContext.
                   Support CertChallenge=ChallFileApp for http challenge, needs
                       code adding in HTTP server onWellKnownDir event but avoids
                       writing files.
                   Removed ALPN handling added in V8.62 which was called too
                      late by OpenSSL to change the SSL context, now checking
                      ALPN earlier from new ClientHello callback.
                   Breaking change!  Internally replaced FRootCAX509 with FX509CAList
                      TX509List for use by ValidateCertChain as Root CA store,
                      specified by file RootCA, loaded by LoadRootCAList and
                      available as RootCAList.  Any applications directly calling
                      ValidateCertChain will need to load CA certificates into a
                      TX509List to pass to that function.
                   Create a self signed SSL certificate so server can start if
                      certificate file can not be found or is missing.  Needed
                      for ChallengeType=ChallAlpnApp to create a new certificate,
                      but always done to make life easier.  Tries to use the
                      specified certificate directory, TEMPDIR if none specified.
                   Don't start SSL certificate order until server is listening.
                   ACME tls-alpn-01 challenge context swapping now logged to
                      X509Certs log instead of debug log.
Dec 09, 2020 V8.65 FPiette made OverbyteIcsSslX509Utils unit loaded only when
                      USE_SLL is defined.
                   Changed Longint to Integer and LongWord to Cardinal to keep
                      MacOS64 happy since it thinks both are 64-bits.
                   Posix fixes.
                   Use X509Log for SSL SNI IcsHost lookup result so we know
                      the correct host has been found.
                   When checking IcsHosts for server name using AUTH command,
                     also check non-SSL ports.
                   Renamed Ics.Posix.Messages.pas to Ics.Posix.PXMessages.pas
Mar 22, 2021 V8.66 Removed support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 whose support ceased
                     Dec 2019, also Fips mode pending 3.0.
                   Added OnBeforeContextInit event which if set is called once before
                     each IcsHosts SslContext is initialised to allow the context
                     parameters to be adjusted for special ciphers or protocols.
                   In 2021 Mozilla now recommends TLSv1.3 as modern ciphers and TLSv1.2/1.3
                     as Intermediate supporting all browsers from last five years, so IcsHosts
                     now use sslCiphersMozillaSrvTLS12 as Intermediate level, also Mozilla
                     recommends no cipher server preference so changed that.
                   Updated SslSrvSecurity levels: sslSrvSecInter, sslSrvSecInterFS and
                     sslSrvSecHigh now all the same TLSv1.2 or 1.3, sslSrvSecTls12Less now
                     TLSv1.2 only, sslSrvSecSsl3 not supported, only sslSrvSecBack supports
                     TLSv1 and 1.1, sslSrvSecTls13Only unchanged TLSv1.3 only.
                   Better error handling when IcsHost SslCert is blank, so SslContext is
                      still created for self signed certificate, thanks to Linden Roth.
Sep 01, 2021 V8.67 OpenSSL 3.0 makes several old ciphers and digests legacy so default
                     for encrypting PFX/P12 files is now PrivKeyEncAES256 with 3.0
                     unless the legacy DLL is loaded when still PrivKeyEncTripleDES
                     so older versions of Windows can load them.
                    Set certificate order output format to OutFmtPwP12 if a password
                      is specified for ordering new certificates.
May 26, 2022 V8.69 Added OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) support using the TOcspHttp
                     component to confirm server SSL/TLS certificates are legitimate and not
                     revoked for security reasons (which (Let's Encrypt did with two days
                     notice on 28 Jan 2022).  The certificate OCSP response is also stapled
                     to the initial SSL/TLS HELO handshake and sent to the client to avoid
                     it needing to lookup OCSP using HTTP itself. OCSP responses are cached
                     and saved to a file for reloading later, but are refreshed every time
                     the certificate is validated, at least once a day. The server property
                     OcspSrvStapling=True enables OCSP checks and stapling only with
                     AUTO_X509_CERTS define since it adds extra HTTP client code. A revoked
                     certificate will be auto ordered.  OCSP checking is done in LoadOneCert
                     and the stapled response sent in TriggerSslServerName when checking SNI.
Oct 10, 2022 V8.70 Removed some AnsiString casts.
Jul 06, 2023 V8.71 Clarify some local vars during certificate ordering.
                   Renamed BuildCertName to BuildCertFName.
                   Ensure inherited destroy called.
                   Increased default IcsHosts SslSrvSecurity to sslSrvSecHigh for TLS/1.2
                     minimum, with certificate key size 2,049 bits and SHA-256 digest.
                   Added CliCertMethod to IcsHosts to allow specific hosts to request a
                     client SSL/TLS certificate rather than all hosts (with SslCliCertMethod).
                     Note either client or server setting may request a client cert request.
                   Added SslLoadSource to IcsHosts to allow SSL/TLS certificates to be
                     loaded from the Windows Certificate Store instead of PEM/PXF files.
                     Defaults to CertLoadFile for files, CertWinStoreMachine or CertWinStoreUser
                     for Windows Stores, HostName[0] is then the common name, part friendly
                     name or a single host name to choose from the store, if there are
                     duplicates the longest expiry date will be chosen. If the certificate
                     name is a wildcard (*), this will be matched with any first node. Note
                     only certificates with exportable private keys will be selected, and the
                     application must have administrator rights to access the Local Machine
                     store.  Only supported if AUTO_X509_CERTS is defined, to avoid bringing
                     in extra units.  Automatic certificate ordering is supported provided
                     SslCert is supplied, and it will be installed into the Windows Store.
                     Although the Current User Store does not need admin rights it is less
                     useful for Windows services which need a login of that user.
Aug 08, 2023 V9.0  Updated version to major release 9.
Feb 25, 2024 V9.1  Added new property NoSSL that prevents use of SSL/TLS, must be set before
                     server is started.
                   TOcspHttp now in OverbyteIcsSslUtils rather than OverbyteIcsSslHttpRest to
                     ease linking.
                   Added OverbyteIcsSslBase which now includes TSslContext, TX509Base and TX509List.
                   Replaced FX509CAList with public IcsSslRootCAStore.
                   Moved BuildCertFName to SslBase.
                   When creating a local SSL/TLS certificate to allow a server to start, ICS
                     now creates a certificate with the IcsHosts.Hosts names signed by an
                     internal ICS intermediate 'ICS Intermediate Short' signed by 'ICS Root CA'
                     which if installed in Windows and browsers will stop certificate warnings
                     appearing.  Previously ICS only created self signed certificates.  The
                     global GSSL_INTER_FILE may be changed to an alternate intermediate bundle.
                     The ICS bundle has the password 'password' and a maximum 100 day life,
                     so new intermediates will be required regularly, to prevent misuse.
                   Use the function IcsInstallIcsRoot to install the ICS root certificate into
                     the Windows Root Store, needs admin rights for the Local Machine store.
                   Added property ListenAny returns true if any sockets are listening, ie server
                     is running.
                   If locally created certificate signed by ICS intermediate is about to expire,
                     replace it.
                   Replace locally created certificate signed by ICS intermediate by Let's
                     Encrypt certificate if automatic ordering enabled.
Sep 16, 2024  V9.3 Using OverbyteIcsTypes for consolidated types and constants, allowing
                     other import units to be removed.
                   Using define MSCRYPT_Servers instead of MSWINDOWS to define IcsHosts
                     can access server certificates in the Windows Store.
                   Ciphers for TLSv12 and TLSv13 now specified separately in SslContext.
                   IcsHosts has new SslCipherList12, SslCipherList13 and SslCryptoGroups
                      properties, which if set are used after the defaults for the specifed
                      sslSrvSecurity have been set, to override them.  May be specified in
                      the IcsHosts INI file separately for each host.
Dec 09, 2024 V9.4  Replace expiring ICS created certificate at same time warnings start
                     instead of 7 days before expiry.
                   Added Error to Disconnect() client method.
Sep 10, 2025 V9.5  Using DEFINE OpenSSL_OcspStaple to conditionally link code relating
                     to stapling an OCSP response to check if server certificate is revoked.
                     Let's Encrypt stopped adding an OCSP URL to certificates in May 2025
                     so only enable this if using authorities that still support OCSP.
                     Note properties OcspSrvStapling and OcspSrvHttp are still published
                     for backward compabibility, but are ignored without the define.
                   IcsHosts has SslRawKeyFile which if non-blank is the private key file
                     for Raw Public Key (RPK) authentication instead of using an X509
                     certificate.  RPK maybe used for client or server authentication.
                       !!!  NOTE PRK not finished yet, pending client and SslContext changes !!!!
                   IcsHosts has AcmeSupplier as TAcmeSupplier to support suppliers other
                     than Let'S Encrypt, and SupplierTitle to specify name of than supplier
                     instead of specifying CertDirWork which will be looked up from
                     C:\ProgramData\ICS-Acme-Accounts\ics-acme-accounts.db.  This supplier
                     accounts database is generally maintained by the OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst
                     sample, which must be used to create accounts for new suppliers,
                     and which may be used to view certificate orders.
                   IcsHosts has AcmeCertProfile to specify the type of certificate
                     requested for Let's Encrypt, listed in FAcmeProfileNames array,
                     default classic, optional tlsserver and shortlived (7 day, not yet
                     available).
                   IcsHosts has AcmeCertValidity to specify certificate life in days, default
                     90, only Google at present, down to 3 days.
                   Certificate ordering now makes use of the Renewal Information API that
                     specifies how many days before expiry a certificate should be
                     renewed, and how often these dates should be rechecked to see if he
                     certificate needs immediate renewal due to being revoked.  This
                     overrides CertExpireDays.  Renewal Information is checked each time
                     the certificate chain is checked, but is cached so there is usually
                     only a server API call every six hours. Note with OCSP gone, this
                     is now the only way to check if a certificate is revoked.
                   Reworked certificate checking if automatic ordering is enabled so
                     that Acme account information is looked up when the certificate is
                     first loaded to get renewal information and maybe working directory,
                     rather than only when time to order a new certificate, so there is
                     more logging and error checking at load time.
                   Temporary ICS self signed certificates are now created in GSSL_CERTS_DIR
                     instead of TempPath.
                   When starting a certificate order, if the challenges have been
                     previously completed OK, collect order immediately, don't try to
                     start them again.  Note with Google collect may not work immediately
                     since certificate processing does not happen during the request, the
                     order timer will repeat collect attempt each five seconds.
                   IcsHosts now ignores DHParams without DEFINE OpenSSL_Deprecated, no
                     longer needed for modern cyphers, probably means DH and DHE ciphers
                     will fail.
                   Fixed a long term problem where SNI checking for a matching IcsHost used
                     the certifcate SANs that might have included a wild card, instead of
                     the Hosts list of host names.  If one IcsHost allowed wild cards it
                     might have been found instead a specific IcsHost for a single host.
                   Automatic certificate ordering in IcsHosts now has a database property
                     CertRenewNow that if set true in the database using the GUI,
                     will override certificate expiry checking and cause an immediate new
                     certificate replacement order by in servers with IcsHosts the next time
                     RecheckSslCerts is called by the server, typically every two hours.
                   Added OnClientAcceptFilter event called before TWSocketServer accepts an
                     incoming connection allowing filtering on the remote IP address so the
                     connection is refused without any more events being called. Server
                     completes TIcsSessIpInfo record with remote and local addresses and
                     ports, event can complete others fields.
Sep 19, 2025 V9.5  IcsHosts has FOrderPending for immediate certificate ordering instead
                     of setting ExpiryDays to -1, improved logging for certificate order
                     reason.
                   certificate ordering supplier account only opened in DoCheckOrderCert,
                     before called DoProcOrderCert.
Oct 15, 2025 V9.5  Unit will build without USE_SSL again.
                   To simplify IcsHosts configuration, added seven new default certificate
                     properties to TSslWSocketServer, SrvSupplierTitle, SrvAcmeSupplier,
                     SrvAcmeCertProfile, SrvAcmeCertValidity, SrvCertChallenge,
                     SrvCertPKeyType and SrvCertSignDigest, which will be used if the
                     similar named (less Srv) IcsHosts properties are not specified.
                     So each IcsHosts only needs CertSupplierProto specified to enable or
                     disable certificate ordering.
                   Updated IcsLoadIcsHostsFromIni with new Server: TWSocketServer argument
                     from which the defaults will be taken. For web servers, pass
                     HttpAppSrv.WSocketServer with the defaults from IcsLoadTHttpAppSrvFromIni.
                   Create a new let's Encrypt account if sufficient details in IcsHosts and
                     there are zero suppliers configured using OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst, the
                     samples have a SupplierTitle 'LetsEncrypt-New'.  Only happens once, in
                     case other INI have incorrect titles. OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst can create
                     multiple acccounts, and must be used for Google since Google account
                     information is needed.
                   Better error handling opening bad certificate file so we can create self
                     signed certificate and then order new cert.
                   Updated all documentation.




Note: Certificate ordering only tested OK with Let's Encrypt and Google.
The extra lines needed for an IcsHost to allow ordering are essentially:

WellKnownPath=d:\websites\well-known\test  (wwere your web site will look for \well-known challenges )
SslCert=c:\certificates\local\test1_ftptest_org.pfx  (file name must match first Hosts name)
CertSupplierProto=SuppProtoAcmeV2 or SuppProtoNone (to disable ordering)
CertChallenge=ChallFileApp or ChallAlpnApp
CertPKeyType=PrivKeyRsa2048 or PrivKeyECsecp256 (or stronger, see below)
CertSignDigest=Digest_sha256  (or stronger, see below)
AcmeCertProfile=tlsserver or classic (only Let's Encrypt at present, shortlived 7 days later in 2025)
AcmeCertValidity=90 (only Google at present, down to 3 days)
AcmeSupplier=AcmeLetsEncrypt or AcmeGoogle
SupplierTitle=AcmeLetsEncrypt-1 or AcmeGoogle-1
(Supplier Database title, maintained by OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst sample, where the Work
Directory and Acme Supplier are specified, and account credentials for Google)
or
CertDirWork=d:\weblogs\acme-certs\  (no Supplier Database, AcmeLetsEncrypt only)





Quick reference guide:
----------------------

TWSocketServer will normally be used to listen on a given TCP port. When a
client connect, it will instantiate a new TWSocketClient component to handle
communication with client. Normally you will derive your own component from
TWSocketClient to add private data and methods to handle it. You tell
TWSocketServer which component it has to instantiate using ClientClass
property. You have to initialize instances from OnClientConnect event handler.
TWSocketServer maintain a list of connected clients. You can access it using
Client[] indexed property and ClientCount property, beware this list is dynamic
as connections are opened and closed, so don't access instances by count.


Automatic Certificate Ordering Supplier Accounts
------------------------------------------------

From V9.5, ICS has a central Acme Supplier Account database that contains a list
of the Acme work directories previously only referenced in separate IcsHosts INI
files. The database is at C:\ProgramData\ICS-Acme-Accounts\ics-acme-accounts.db,
and each Supplier Account has a Supplier Account Title, Acme Supplier Name, and
Account Directory, which defaults to: C:\ProgramData\ICS-Acme-Accounts\SupplierTitle\
but can be located elsewhere if required.

If an ICS server with automatic certificate ordering starts and no Acme Supplier
Accounts are configured, the server will attempt to create one.  If the INI file
was used prior to V9.5 and CertDirWork is specified with old account details,
a new supplier AcmeLetsEncrypt-Old is created for that existing directory, and
everything should work as previously.  If the INI file has SupplierTitle, no
CertDirWork and sufficient details in IcsHosts, a new supplier is created with
that title, the ICS samples use 'LetsEncrypt-New'.  Note this only happens if
no suppliers are configured, so a typo in INI file does not create an unwanted
supplier.

Otherwise, Acme Supplier Accounts must be created manually using the sample
OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst or functions from the TSslX509Certs component in your
application.  Note Google and other supplier accounts must be created manually,
since they need extra external accounting details that are not in IcsHosts.

Each Supplier Account has an Account Directory in which the account private
key file AcmePrivateKey.pem is created and stored, and all certificate and
related files will be saved, with a database file ics-control.db containing
information about the account, certificate orders and pending challenges.
The account private key (separate to certificate private keys) is used to
identify the account to the supplier and is created automatically if the
directory is blank. This account private key will be needed to cancel or
revoke any certificates issued using it.  Note an account directory and
database can only be accessed by one application at a time, they can
generally not be shared between different servers.

The sample OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst has tabs 'Acme Suppliers' and  'Supplier
Details' that allows accounts to be created and edited, see later for details.


IcsHosts
--------

When originally designed TWSocketServer only supported listening on a single IP
address and port, subsequently MultiListenSockets were added to listen on multiple
IP addresses and ports, and TSslWSocketServer SSL support required a lot of extra
code in the application to specify SSL certificates, protocols, ciphers and
security using multiple SslContexts for multiple hosts.

The IcsHosts property is an alternate way for specifying multiple listeners for
TSslWSocketServer that allows multiple hosts to be specified, each with one or
two IP addresses and non-SSL and SSL port bindings, SSL certificates and private
key (usually combined in a bundle), SSL context and security level, and other web
server host related properties (used by higher level components).  Each IcsHost
has one or more HostNames to which it will recognise, that can share IP addresses.
The same IP address can be used by two more IcsHosts with differing host names
and other settings.  IcsHosts include properties for use by other components,
such as web, proxy and FTP servers, and for automatic SSL/TLS certificate ordering.

If IcsHosts is specified, TSslWSocketServer ignores existing bindings and SSL
context, and creates new bindings and initializes an SSL context for each host
checking and reporting all server certificate chains.  To ease implementation,
functions are provided to read IcsHosts and TWSocketServer from an INI file, or
they may be specified through IDE form properties and saved by other means.

Note IcsHosts is only available for TSslWSocketServer, not TWSocketServer, but
you don't need to use SSL for any Hosts.

HostNames     - A list of one or more domain Host Names for which this IcsHost
                will respond, set as a TStringList, but read from the INI file
                as a  comma separated list, no quotes. Host Names are matched
                initially against SSL Server Name Indication (SNI), or against
                the HTTP Host: header if no SSL or SNI for web and proxy servers.
                Note INI file reads as Hosts.  Wildcard host names with a * are
                not allowed.
HostEnabled   - True or False if this IcsHost is enabled, NOTE INI file also
                reads Enabled if HostEnabled missing for backward compatibility.
BindIpAddr    - Listening IPv4 or IPv6 Address for this IcsHost, may be 0.0.0.0
                for all IP Addresses, must exist.  Multiple IcsHosts can use the
                same IP Address which will then be chosen from HostNames using
                SNI or Host: header.
BindIpAddr2   - Optional second IP Address for this IcsHost, perhaps an IPv6
                address.
BindNonPort   - Optional non-SSL/TLS Port, may be blank or zero if only SSL is
                supported by IcsHost, usually 80 for HTTP, required if
                WellKnownPath specified for SSL automatic certificates.
BindSslPort   - Optional SSL/TLS Port, may be blank or zero if SSL not supported
                by IcsHost, if used generally 443 for HTTPS, and several other SSL
                parameters are required.  Either BindNonPort or BindSslPort is
                required.
HostTag       - A short alphabetic name for the IcsHost, used variously in
                high level servers.  The web application server uses HostTag in
                the AddGetHandler, AddPostHandler and AddGetAllowedPath to cause
                that handler to be matched.  The proxy server uses HostTag to
                match source to one or more targets.  When SocketServer creates
                a TWSocketClient for a new connection it sets the IcsHostIdx and
                HostTag properties to this value, also ServerAddr and ServerPort
                for the bindings.
Descr         - Optional free description of the IcsHost, may be used for logging.
Proto         - Optional high level protocol used by this IcsHost, used variously
                in servers.  The proxy server uses HTTP, SMTP, POP3, etc.
ForwardProxy  - Optional True/False used by the proxy server if this IcsHost is
                functioning as a Forward Proxy rather than a Reverse Proxy. A
                forward supports multiple targets according to the URL, while a
                reverse proxy generally ignores the URL and has a single fixed
                target, sometimes multiple fixed targets depending on the URL.
                See OverbyteIcsProxy.pas for more information.
WebDocDir     - Optional default web document directory for this IcsHost, used by
                the web server.
WebTemplDir   - Optional default web template directory for this IcsHost, used by
                the web server.
WebDefDoc     - Optional default web document for this IcsHost, used by the web
                server.
WebLogDir     - Optional web logging directory for this IcsHost, for use by web
                server applications (not by the server itself which has not
                logging).
WebLogIdx     - Optional web logging index for this IcsHost, for use by web
                server applications (not by the server itself which has not
                logging).
AuthSslCmd    - Optional, if SSL/TLS should be initialised to support an AUTH SSL
                command or similar on an initial non-SSL connection. Used by FTP.
AuthForceSsl  - Optional, if login only allowed once SSL/TLS negotiated so
                   credentials never sent clear.  Used by FTP.
SslLoadSource - Optional, specifies the source for loading SSL/TLS certificates.
                Defaults to CertLoadFile for PEM/PFX files where SslCert is a
                file name with path and extension. CertWinStoreMachine or
                CertWinStoreUser specifies load from the Windows Certificate Stores
                where HostNames[0] is the common name, part friendly name or a single
                host name to choose from the store, if there are duplicates the
                longest expiry data will be chosen.  If the certificate name is a
                wildcard (*), this will also matched with any first node. Note only
                certificates with exportable private keys will be selected, and the
                application must have administrator rights to access the Local Machine
                store.
SslCert       - Optional SSL server certificate file name, may be PEM, DER, PFX,
                P12, P7 format, optionally a bundle including a private key and
                one or more intermediate certificates.  Required if BindSslPort
                set. If a private key is included, will use SslPassword for an
                encrypted file. Rather than a file name, may be an ASCII PEM string
                containing the certificate without any line endings.  HostNames
                will be checked against those listed on the certificate, and a not
                warning given for mismatches so a single certificate needs to
                contain all the HostName, or wild cards * so they match.
                TSslWSocketServer has a method RecheckSslCerts that should be
                called from the server application periodically, at least once
                a day, which will check the certificate file time stamp and
                reload it if changed, issue warnings if it expires within
                CertExpireDays (default 30) and optionally order a new
                certificate, see CertSupplierProto below.  Note if automatic
                certificate ordering is used, the file name in SslCert must
                conform to the format used by the TSslX509Certs component, with
                the host name having all dots replaced by underscore and * by x,
                then with suffix .pfx or -bundle.pem, ie test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-bundle.pem
                or test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk.pfx.
                Important: if the SslCert file does not exist, ICS will create
                it signed by the ICS intermediate and root, so the server cam
                start, generally expecting it to be replaced automatically by
                one automatically ordered from Let's Encrypt or Google Trust Services.
SslKey        - Optional SSL private key file name, PEM format, will use
                SslPassword for an encrypted file.  Ignored if SslCert was a
                bundle file with a private key.  Note all SSL servers need an
                SSL certificate and matching private key to function, and these
                are checked before the server will start. Rather than a file
                name, may be an ASCII PEM string containing the private key
                without any line endings.
SslInter      - Optional SSL intermediate certificate bundle file name, PEM, DER,
                P12 or P7 format. Ignored if SslCert was a bundle with
                intermediate certificates.  The SSL certificate chains is checked
                to ensure the server certificate is signed by an intermediate or
                trusted root certificate, and likewise the intermediate(s).
                ICS is usually built with a bundle of trusted root certificates
                linked into applications and loaded on start-up.
SslPassword   - Optional password for the SSL private key, if encrypted.  Note
                this is clear text in the INI file, steps should be taken to read
                an encrypted password if security is required.  Beware most
                PFX/P12 bundles need a password, since Windows will not import
                them without a password.
SslSrvSecurity - Optional SSL server security level, that sets protocol, cipher
                and SslSecLevel according to eight levels from type TSslSrvSecurity:
                sslSrvSecNone, sslSrvSecSsl3, sslSrvSecBack, sslSrvSecInter,
                sslSrvSecInterFS, sslSrvSecHigh, sslSrvSecHigh128, sslSrvSecHigh192.
                Details of each are in the OverbyteIcsSSLEAY.pas unit.  Beware the
                server may not start, ie High128 requires an RSA private key length
                greater than the 2,048 bits commonly used.  If not specified,
                sslSrvSecDefault is used which is currently sslSrvSecHigh
                meaning TLSv1.2 or later with forward security ciphers.
CliCertMethod  - Optional, defaults to sslCliCertNone, allows host to request a client
                SSL certificate from the browser or remote application, as type
                TSslCliCertMethod, for sslCliCertOptional or sslCliCertRequire.
                Require will close the connection unless a valid certificate is
                received and validated against RootCA. Beware requesting a client
                certificate usually causes the browser to prompt the user for which
                certificate to send which can be obtrusive.
SslCipherList12 - Optional, list of ciphers the server will accept for TLSv1.2
                connections, see constant sslCiphersMozillaSrvTLS12 for example.
SslCipherList13 - Optional, list of ciphers the server will accept for TLSv1.3
                connections, see constant sslCipherSuitesTLS13 for example.
SslCryptoGroups - Optional, list of crypto groups the server will accept, see
                constant sslCryptoGroupsDef for example.
SslRawKeyFile   - Optional, the private key file for Raw Public Key (RPK)
                authentication instead of using an X509 certificate.  RPK maybe
                used for client or server authentication. !!  NOTE RPK not finished yet !!!
WellKnownPath   - Optional, full file directory path for .Well-Known web URLs, used
                 by the web and proxy servers for automated SSL certificates.
WebRedirectURL  - Optional, a web server redirection URL, used in the proxy server
                to redirect HTTP connections to HTTPS, if WebRedirectStat is none
                zero.  Not currently used by the web server, but web server
                applications can add event code to use these values, see event
                SslHttpAppSrv1GetDocument in OverbyteIcsSslMultiWebServ1.pas.
                Or more intelligent redirection could be implemented like
                changing http:// to https://.
WebRedirectStat - Optional, a web server redirection status code, 301, 302, 307
                or 308 depending on reason.
CertSupplierProto - Optional, if SSL X509 certificates are to be automatically
                ordered, downloaded and installed, specifies the Protocol to be
                used as type TSupplierProto. Currently supports only SuppProtoNone
                and SuppProtoAcmeV2. Ignored unless TSslWSocketServer property
                SslCertAutoOrder is True.  As of V9.5, this is the only IcsHost
                property needed for automatic certificate ordering, since the
                other properties now have common defaults in TSslWSocketServer.
                Note any SSL certificates ordered will use all HostNames, also
                wild card certificates can not be ordered by IcsHosts, only using
                TSslX509Certs.
                Automatic certificate ordering is triggered by calling the server
                method RecheckSslCerts after the server has started listening,
                which checks all certificates and chains for expiry within
                CertExpireDays (default 30) and will then order a new certificate
                for any that fail, including certificate file missing.  The server
                application should call RecheckSslCerts at least once a day, but
                it can be more often to give more chances to check for ordering
                problems.  The TSslX509Certs component has an internal timer that
                checks for order completion and calls an onNewCert event when the
                new certificate is ready, this event should call RecheckSslCerts
                again which will find the new certificate file and load it into
                SslContext.
CertDirWork     - Optional, ignored if CertSupplierProto is not SuppProtoNone.
                For V9.5 and later, not needed since accounts are saved by
                SupplierName, generally in C:\ProgramData\ICS-Acme-Accounts.
                For earlier versions, specifies the Certificate Database Working
                Directory, in which an account that matches CertSupplierProto
                should already have been created, see OverbyteIcsSslX509Certs.pas
                for more information.
SupplierTitle   - Optional, defaults to SrvSupplierTitle in TSslWSocketServer so
                generally not needed in IcsHosts.  Supplier Account Title, used to
                look up AcmeSupplier and CertDirWork from ics-acme-accounts.db.
AcmeSupplier    - Optional, defaults to SrvAcmeSupplier in TSslWSocketServer so
                generally not needed in IcsHosts.  Specifies one of several ACME
                suppliers of type TAcmeSupplier: AcmeLetsEncrypt, AcmeLetsEncryptTest,
                AcmeZeroSSL, AcmeGoogle, AcmeGoogleTest, AcmeDigicert,
                AcmeDigicertTest, AcmeSslcomRSA, AcmeSslcomECC.  The names with test
                specify use the suppliers testing or staging servers that generally
                issue fake certificates for testing and don't care about errors.
AcmeCertProfile - Optional, defaults to SrvAcmeCertProfile in TSslWSocketServer so
                generally not needed in IcsHosts.  Currently only used by Let's
                Encrypt to specify certificate profile: classic, tlsserver or
                shortlived (seven days).
AcmeCertValidity - Optional, defaults to SrvAcmeCertValidity in TSslWSocketServer
                so generally not needed in IcsHosts. Currently Google only,
                specifies the certificate expiry days, default 90, seven supported.
CertChallenge   - Optional, defaults to SrvCertChallenge in TSslWSocketServer so
                generally not needed in IcsHosts. Specifies the domain name
                Challenge Type as TChallengeType:  ChallNone, ChallFileUNC,
                ChallFileFtp, ChallFileSrv, ChallFileApp, ChallDnsAuto, ChallDnsMan,
                ChallEmail, ChallAlpnUNC, ChallAlpnSrv and ChallAlpnApp.
CertPKeyType  - Optional, defaults to SrvCertPKeyType in TSslWSocketServer so
                generally not needed in IcsHosts. Specifies the new SSL certificate
                Private Key algorithm and key length as type TSslPrivKeyType:
                PrivKeyRsa2048, PrivKeyRsa3072, PrivKeyRsa4096, PrivKeyECsecp256,
                PrivKeyECsecp384, PrivKeyECsecp512.
CertSignDigest - Optional, defaults to SrvCertSignDigest in TSslWSocketServer so
                generally not needed in IcsHosts. Specifies the new SSL certificate
                request signing digest as type TEvpDigest: Digest_sha256,
                Digest_sha384 or Digest_sha512.

Once IcsHosts have been validated, a number of read only properties are available
with more information about the IcsHost from the certificate and bindings, that
may be usefully logged for configuration and error checking purposes.

SslCtx       - TSslContext component used by IcsHost.
HostNameTot  - Number of items in HostNames TStrings.
DisplayName  - IcsHost display name, variously using HostTag, Descr, and bind
             IP addresses and ports.
CertDomains  - Comma separated list of SSL certificate host names from Subject
             Alternate Names field.
CertInfo     - A long multiple line text block describing all the main fields of
             one or more SSL certificates in the chain including subject,
             issuer, expiry, public key type and signature method.
BindInfo     - List of one or more IP addresses and ports.
CertExiry    - SSL certificate expiry UTC date and time, as TDateTime.
CertFStamp   - Unix file time stamp for SSL server certificate, to check if
             changed.
InterFStamp  - Unix file time stamp for SSL intermediate certificates, to check
             if changed.
CertErrs     - Description of any errors found in the SSL certificate chain
             during validation.
CertValRes   - SSL certificate chain validation result as type TChainResult,
             chainOK, chainFail, chainWarn, chainNone.
BindIdxNone  - MultiListenIdx for first IP address, non-SSL.
BindIdxSsl   - MultiListenIdx for first IP address, SSL.
BindIdx2None - MultiListenIdx for second IP address, non-SSL.
BindIdx2Ssl  - MultiListenIdx for second IP address, SSL.
BindSrvPort  - Actual listening port, useful if Port=0 for dynamic port.
RenewalDays  - For automatically issued certificates, how many days before
             expiry the supplier recommends renewing the certificate,
             generally two thirds of the way through duration, but could
             be sooner if the certificate is cancelled or revoked.
             Internally, this tells ICS when to order a new certificate.
RenewRetryDT - For automatically issued certificates, when the supplier
             recommends next checking the renew dates, they may change.
             Usually every six to 24 hours.
RenewCheckDT - For automatically issued certificates, when last checked
             renewal dates.


TSslWSocketServer
-----------------

Proto        - Server protocol, always TCP.
Addr         - Server listen IP address, IPv4 or IPv6, maybe 0.0.0.0 or :: to
               listen on all available addresses, ignored if any IcsHosts
               specified.  IP address must exist and not be in use elsewhere
               for the same port.
Port         - Server listen port, usually 80 or 443, ignored if any IcsHosts
               specified, zero means dynamic port.
BindPort     - While listening actual port, useful if Port=0 for dynamic port.
SocketFamily - IP address socket family as TSocketFamily, from sfIPv4, sfIPv6.
SslEnable    - True if an SSL connection should be negotiated. ignored if any
               IcsHosts specified.
SslContext   - Assign to an TSslContext component for SSL support, where SSL
               certificates, keys, protocols and ciphers are specified, ignored
               if any IcsHosts specified.
MultiListenSockets - Allows one or more extra server listen IP addresses and
               ports to be specified, as type TWSocketMultiListenCollection,
               allowing server to listen on several IP addresses/ports at the
               same time, in addition to the that specified as Addr/Port props.
               Each TWSocketMultiListenItem has Addr, Port, SocketFamily,
               SslEnable and ListenBacklog properties. Better to use IcsHosts
               for new applications which does the same, ignored if any IcsHosts
               specified.
MultiListenIndex - Read only, which listen socket accepted last connection, -1
               if default Addr.Poprt used, 0 or above is index into
               MultiListenSockets collection.
MaxClients   - Maximum number of simultaneous clients the server should accept
               if non-zero.  Any further clients will receive then BannerTooBusy
               response and the connection closed, until earlier connections
               are closed.
Banner       - If non-blank, a text string that will be sent in response to a
               new incoming connection, should generally be blank.
BannerTooBusy - If non-blank, a text string that will be sent once MaxClients
               is exceeded.
ClientClass  - The class type the application has derived from TSslWSocketClient
               for client application code.
Client       - Currently active clients of ClientClass, indexed base zero.  Note
               the index value may change each time a new client connects or
               disconnects, so check CliId to confirm it's the correct one.
ClientCount  - Number of active client connected.
SocketErrs   - How socket error messages should be presented as type TSocketErrs,
               wsErrTech or wsErrFriendly.
ExclusiveAddr - True is other applications should be blocked from sharing the
               server IP addresses.
ListenBacklog - How many new client connections should be queued by Windows while
               the server accepts them, before the server starts rejecting new
               connections by immediately closing them.  Recommended as 15 for
               heavy use servers, may be up to 250.
IcsHosts     - Allows one or more TIcsHosts to be set, as TIcsHostCollection, an
               alternate way for specifying multiple listeners that allows
               multiple hosts to be specified, each with one or two IP addresses
               and non-SSL and SSL port bindings, SSL certificates and private
               key (perhaps combined in a bundle), SSL context and security level,
               and other web server host related properties (used by higher level
               components).  Each IcsHost has one or more HostNames to which it
               will recognise, that can share IP addresses.  See above for more
               detail.
RootCA       - Specifying a file name containing a PEM bundle of trusted root SSL
               certificates allows validation of SSL server certificate chains.
               ICS includes RootCaCertsBundle.pem (large) and TrustedCABundle.pem
               (medium size), and a default built-in (small) that will be used
               if no file is specified.
DHParams     - Specifies a DHParams file name, created using the PenTools sample,
               or use the provided dhparam1024.pem or dhparam2048.pem files. Used
               for DH and DHE ciphers, but not needed for modern ECDHE ciphers.
               Rather than a file name, may be an ASCII PEM string containing
               the DHParams without any line endings.
SslCliCertMethod - Allows server to request a client SSL certificate from the
               browser or remote application, as type TSslCliCertMethod, with
               sslCliCertNone, sslCliCertOptional or sslCliCertRequire. Require
               will close the connection unless a valid certificate is received
               and validated against RootCA. Beware requesting a client
               certificate usually causes the browser to prompt the user for
               which certificate to send which can be obtrusive.
CertExpireDays - When using IcsHosts, the number of days before an SSL server
               certificate is due to expire that warnings will be generated (by
               the method RecheckSslCerts, perhaps triggering automatic SSL
               certificate ordering.  May be overriden by automatically ordered
               certificates that declare their own renewal recommendation.
SslCertAutoOrder - True if IcsHosts are allowed to order and install SSL
               certificates automatically.  Requires SslX509Certs property to
               be set, and CertSupplierProto set for any IcsHost that will order
               certificates.
ServSupplierTitle - Optional, ignored without SslCertAutoOrder=True. Supplier
               Account Title, used to look up AcmeSupplier and CertDirWork from
               ics-acme-accounts.db.  See earlier for more information.
               Note that all IcsHosts must have the same SupplierTitle and
               AcmeSupplier, you can not mix suppliers on a server.
ServAcmeSupplier - Optional, ignored without SslCertAutoOrder=True.  Specifies
                one of several ACME suppliers of type TAcmeSupplier: AcmeLetsEncrypt,
                AcmeLetsEncryptTest, AcmeZeroSSL, AcmeGoogle, AcmeGoogleTest,
                AcmeDigicert, AcmeDigicertTest, AcmeSslcomRSA, AcmeSslcomECC.
                The names with test specify use the suppliers testing or staging
                servers that generally issue fake certificates for testing and
                don't care about errors.
                Note: TSslWSocketServer will only automatically create a new
                supplier account for AcmeLetsEncrypt, any other AcmeSuppliers
                must have an account created using externally, usually using
                the OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst sample, since they may need extra
                information not specified here.
ServAcmeCertProfile - Optional, ignored without SslCertAutoOrder=True.
                Currently only used by Let's Encrypt to specify certificate
                profile: classic, tlsserver or shortlived (seven days).
ServAcmeCertValidity - Optional, ignored without SslCertAutoOrder=True.
                Currently Google only, specifies the certificate expiry days,
                default 90, seven days supported.
ServCertChallenge - Optional, ignored without SslCertAutoOrder=True.
                Specifies the domain name Challenge Type as TChallengeType:
                ChallNone, ChallFileUNC, ChallFileFtp, ChallFileSrv, ChallFileApp,
                ChallDnsAuto, ChallDnsMan, ChallEmail, ChallAlpnUNC, ChallAlpnSrv
                and ChallAlpnApp. Note most challenges need a little extra code
                in the server application.  Different types of servers usually
                need differing challenges: web servers are usually ChallFileApp
                where the well-known directory is used on port 80 or
                ChallAlpnApp where the SSL HELO on port 443 passes a special
                ALPN; FTP servers don't listen on ports 80 or 443, so need to
                use a local web server on port 80 with ChallFileSrv, likewise
                proxy servers not using 80/43.
ServCertPKeyType - Optional, ignored without SslCertAutoOrder=True.  Specifies
                the new SSL certificate Private Key algorithm and key length
                as type TSslPrivKeyType: PrivKeyRsa2048, PrivKeyRsa3072,
                PrivKeyRsa4096, PrivKeyECsecp256, PrivKeyECsecp384,
                PrivKeyECsecp512, although the supplier may reject any of them.
                Beware RSA keys longer than 4,096 bits can take many minutes
                to generate the key blocking the server.
ServCertSignDigest - Optional, ignored without SslCertAutoOrder=True. Specifies
                the new SSL certificate request signing digest as type
                TEvpDigest: Digest_sha256, Digest_sha384 or Digest_sha512.
SslX509Certs - Assign to a TSslX509Certs component if automatic SSL certificate
               ordering is required.  Ir ia very important that the onCertProg
               is used to log progress messages from the certificate ordering
               process in case of errors.  The onCertsChallengeDNS event is
               called if a DNS server should be updated, onCertsOAuthAuthUrl if
               0Auth2 authenication is needed, and onCertsNewCert when a new
               certificate is available which should be logged and the
               RecheckSslCerts method called to cause the server to load it.
OcspStapling - Support OCSP revocation checking and OCSP Stapling for all
               hosts and certificates.  V9.5 reqyuires DEFINE OpenSSL_OcspStaple.
NoSSL        - If True, prevents SSL/TLS being used.


TSslWSocketClient
-----------------

Each new incoming connection to TSslWSocketServer causes a new instance of
TSslWSocketClient to be created, with a number of read only properties set,
that may be useful for client application code.  Generally, applications will
create their own class descended from TSslWSocketClient which is where all
the code to listen to requests and send responses will go.

Server      - TCustomWSocketServer component to which the client belongs.
PeerAddr    - Remote IP address of the client, IPv4 or IPv6.
PeerPort    - Remote IP port of the client.
SessionClosedFlag - True if the client is in the process of closing.
CliId       - A sequential client ID number that may be used to identify the
              client, note clients are creating and destroyed regularly.
IcsHostIdx  - If 0 or higher index into the IcsHosts collection, -1 if
              IcsHosts not used.
MultiListenIdx - -1 if default SocketServer listener used, 0 or above is
              index into MultiListenSockets collection.
HostTag     - A short alphabetic name for the IcsHost, used variously in
              high level servers.
CServerAddr - Local server IP address for listener.
CServerPort - Local server IP port for listener.
